<h3 class="nobreak">I.<br />


ON ART AND SARDINES&mdash;BUT MORE ESPECIALLY SARDINES.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no pleasanter, sweeter, healthier spot than
the Backs of the Colleges.</p>

<p>Get into your canoe at Silver Street. Put into that
canoe:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The cushions of three other boats.</p>

<p>(2) Two pipes, in order that one may be always cool,
and tobacco.</p>

<p>(3) One dozen boxes of matches, in order that one box
may be always handy.</p>

<p>(4) The spiritual part of your nature, which will not take
up much room, but is useful to talk to.</p>

<p>But do not take another man with you. I may frankly
say, my reader, that you are absolutely the only man I
know who has the keen appreciativeness, the capacity for
quiet meditation, the dreaminess, the listlessness, the
abominable laziness, that a Canadian canoe requires.</p>

<p>The man who would attempt to get pace on in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Canadian canoe probably would analyse the want of harmony
in the death-song which a swan never sings&mdash;or worse than
that.</p>

<p>The man who would try to make a Canadian canoe go
where he wanted would be angry, because the inspiration
of a poet does not always disappoint the expectations of a
commonplace nature. You must go where the boat wants
to go; and that depends upon wind and current, and on the
number of other boats that run into you, and the way they
do it, and the language of their occupants.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What a beautiful thing it is to lie at full length on
the cushions, and see the sky through the trees&mdash;only the
angels see the trees through the sky. My boat has taken
me round to the back of Queen&#8217;s, and stopped just short
of that little bridge. It is all old and familiar. The fowls
coo as they cooed yesterday. The same two men in the
same tub have the same little joke with one another in
getting under the low bridge. Farther up, there is precisely
the same number of flies on the same dead and putrescent
animal. My boat went up to look at it, but could not
stay. The recoil sent it back here; and here, apparently,
it means to stop. You may take my word for it that a
Canadian canoe knows a thing or two.</p>

<p>I wish I could paint the song of the birds and set the
beauty of the trees to music. But there is a prejudice
against it. Music is masculine, Art is feminine, and Poetry
is their child. The baby Poetry will play with any one;
but its parents observe the division of sexes. That is why
Nature is so decent and pleasant. I would treat her to
some poetry if I did but know the names of things. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
instance, I have no idea what that bird is, and asparagus
is the only tree which I recognise at sight.</p>

<p>I suppose you know that Art and Music are separated
now. They sometimes meet, but they never speak. In
the vacation I met them both one night by the edge of the
sea; but they did not notice me. Art was busy in catching
the effect of the moonlight and the lights on the pier. She
did it well, and made it more beautiful than the reality
seemed. Music listened to the wash of the waves, the
thin sound of the little pebbles drawn back into the sea,
and the constant noise of a low wind. He sat at a big
organ, which was hidden from my sight by dark curtains
of cloud; and as he played the music of all things came
out into a song which was better than all things: for Art
and Music are not only imitative, but creative. At present
they are allowed to create only shadows, by the rules of the
game. But I have been told that the old quarrel between
them&mdash;I have no conception what the quarrel was about&mdash;will
be made up one day, and they will love one another
again. Their younger child, who will then be born, will
take unto himself the strength and beauty of Art and
Music and Poetry. He will be different from all three,
and his name is not fixed yet.</p>

<p>Oh, confound the boat! I wish I&#8217;d tied it up. It&#8217;s just
taken the painter between its teeth, and whipped sharp
round and bolted. Woa, my lass, steady! It&#8217;s a little
fresh, you see, not having been out before this week. I
<i>beg</i> your pardon, sir&mdash;<i>entirely</i> my fault.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think he need have been so offensively rude
about it. It&#8217;s not as if I&#8217;d upset him.</p>

<p>A fish jumped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>I know not the names of fishes, but it was not salmon
steak or filleted soles, of that I&#8217;m sure. My boat goes
waggling its silly old bows as if it knew but would not tell
me. Can it have been a sardine?</p>

<p>No; the sardine is a foreign fish. It comes from
Sardinia, where the Great Napoleon was exiled, as likely
as not. It cannot swim in fresh water, but is brought to
us in tins, which are packed in crates on trucks. It comes
<i>en huiles</i>, in fact. Hence the inscription.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking of the sad story of those two
historical sardines&mdash;a buck-sardine and a doe-sardine&mdash;that
lived on opposite sides of an island, which happened to be
in the &AElig;gean Sea.</p>

<p>They loved one another dearly; but they never, never
told their love. He had no self-confidence, and she had
too much self-respect. They met but once before their last
day. It was at a place of worship in the neighbourhood of
the Goodwin Sands. She caught his eye, and the umpire
gave it out, and he had to go out. &#8220;Am I a hymn?&#8221; he
said, just a little bitterly, &#8220;that I should be given out?&#8221;
He was not a hymn, but he was a he, and had a tender
heart.</p>

<p>All day long he sat on a stone, tail uppermost, and felt
his position acutely. &#8220;Ah, if she only knew!&#8221; he sighed
to himself.</p>

<p>And she was the life and soul of a select party in the
roaring Adriatic. She quipped, and quirked; she became
so brilliant that the surface of the sea grew phosphorescent.
And no one guessed that beneath that calm exterior the
worm was gnawing at the heart of the poor doe-sardine.
No one would have been so foolish. For is it not well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
known that when a worm and a fish meet it&#8217;s mostly the
fish that does the gnawing? Still, the doe-sardine did feel
a trifle weary. Why might she not tell her love? Why
must she suffer?</p>

<p>&#8220;Il faut souffrir pour &ecirc;tre belle,&#8221; as the gong said when
the butler hit it.</p>

<p>About this time a young man, who was dancing attendance
on Queen Cleopatra, happened to be passing on a P.N.O.
steamer. This was in the republican era, when Duilius
introduced the P.N.O. line. The Carthaginian merchants,
with a keen eye for business, always used P.T.O. steamers,
which were insured far beyond their value by unsuspecting
offices in the less tutored parts of Spain. These wild tribes
did not know what P.T.O. signified, but the steamers did;
so did the crews of low Teutonic slaves, who were thus
saved all the worry and expense of burial.</p>

<p>But let us return to our sardines. The young man on
the P.N.O. steamer was reading a novel of Ouida&#8217;s; and,
misliking the book, he flung it into the ocean. The
attendants of the doe-sardine brought it to their mistress,
and she read it with avidity, and after that she became
very elegant, and very French.</p>

<p>She sat in the rose-tinted boudoir, with a sad smile on
her gills, dreaming of her love. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; she murmured
faintly, &#8220;Si vous saviez.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not sleep! No sooner had she closed her
eyes than she was haunted by an awful vision of a man
soldering up tins of fish. The doctors prescribed narcotics.
When she had taken the morphia of the doctors she had
no more fear of the dream. But she took too much of it.
She took all there was of it. Then the doctors prescribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
coral, and she took any amount of coral. She would have
taken in a reef; but the auctioneer was away for his Easter
holidays, and consequently there were no sales. So she
took in washing instead. Then, and not till then, she
knew that she must die.</p>

<p>A fishing-net was passing, and a conductor stood on the
step. &#8220;&#8217;Ere yer are, lyedy!&#8221; he called out. &#8220;Hall the
way&mdash;one penny! Benk, Benk, Gritty Benk!&#8221; He used
to say this so quickly that he was called the lightning
conductor. She entered the net, and as she did so she
saw the buck-sardine seated there. She staggered, and
nearly fell!</p>

<p>&#8220;Moind the step, lyedy,&#8221; cried the conductor.</p>

<p>And so they were brought to the gritty bank of the
Mediterranean, and received temporary accommodation
without sureties or publicity&mdash;on note-of-hand simply. As
they came in with the tide, they were naturally paid into
the current account.</p>

<p>They were preserved in the same tin, and served on the
same piece of buttered toast.</p>

<p>As the man consumed the bodies of the buck-sardine
and the doe-sardine, the two spiritualities of the two fishes
walked down the empyrean, and cast two shadows.</p>

<p>When he had gulped down the last mouthful, the two
shadows melted into one.</p>

<p>So they found peace at last; and I do not refer to
buttered toast. But the queerest part of it is that they
were both sprats.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has turned chilly. No one but myself is left on the
river, and the solitary end of the afternoon is good to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
look at. The thing that you and I want most is a power
of expression. When I say you, I mean the sympathetic
reader who can enter into the true spirit of loafing: the
loafing of the body in the wayward Canadian canoe that
does what it likes, and the loafing of the mind that does
not take the nauseous trouble to think straight. I want
the younger child who is to be born when Art and Music
are reconciled again, who will never take aim and yet
never miss the mark, who will be quite careless but quite
true. That child will know all about the sympathy which
exists between one man and one scene in which he finds
himself, and may perhaps reveal it to us.</p>

<p>But I am sorry for poor Art. She is a woman, and,
though her beauty will not leave her, she desires reconciliation
and love.</p>

<p>I am taken with a sudden verse or two. Kindly excuse
them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">O Art, that lives not in the studio,</div>
<div class="indent2">That has no special love for northern light!</div>

<div class="indent">So in despair I wax a trifle coarse,</div>

ON EXALTATION: TOGETHER WITH AN ANECDOTE FROM<br />
THE ENTERTAINMENTS OF KAPNIDES.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON quiet days, when no wind blows, my canoe is
particularly restful. It has perfect sympathy with
the weather. It creeps down slowly to King&#8217;s, leans itself
against the bank, and thinks. Then, later in the afternoon,
it bears the organ humming in the chapel&mdash;a faint, sweet
sound which produces religious exaltation; and it becomes
necessary to wrestle with the canoe, because it desires to
fly away and be at rest. It is owing to this rhythmic
alternation of laziness and spirituality in the boat that I
have given it the name which is blazoned on its bows&mdash;<i>Zeitgeist</i>.</p>

<p>I have said the boat has sympathy with the weather.
It also has sympathy with me, or I have sympathy with
it, which is the same thing. There was a time when I
suffered only from rhythmic alternations of two kinds of
laziness. Now exaltation is beginning to enter in as well,
and I do not know the reason, unless I have caught it from
the boat. Materialistic friends have told me that too much
pudding will cause exaltation. I have not so much as
looked upon pudding this day. An unknown poet comes
swiftly past me. I hail him, and ask him for information.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
He tells me that he had been that way himself, and that
with him it is generally caused by the scent of gardenias,
or hyacinths, or narcissus.</p>

<p>I am glad he has gone away. I think if he had stayed
a moment longer I should have been a little rude.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have got it. When one suffers from it,
memory-vignettes come up quickly before the mental eye,
and the mental eye has a rose-tinted glass stuck in it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">O passi graviora, dabit deus his quoque finem.</div>
</div></div>

<p>That is a memory-vignette. I am back again at school
in a low form, and I am asked to parse &#8220;passi,&#8221; and I
parse it humorously, and there is awful silence; and then
one sharp click, because the master in nervous irritation
snaps in two the cedar pencil in his hand. I hate him,
and he hates me. For the meaning of the words I care
nothing. Now I think over them again, and I see that
Virgil is very intimate with me, and that he knows the way
I feel.</p>

<p>Up comes another quotation, this time from a more
modern author:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The sun was gone now; the curled moon</div>
<div class="indent">Was like a little feather</div>
<div class="verse">Fluttering far down the gulf; and now</div>
<div class="indent">She spoke through the still weather:</div>
<div class="verse">Her voice was like the voice the stars</div>
<div class="indent">Had when they sang together.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, and if he had said that the curled moon was like
a bitten biscuit thrown out of window in a high wind, it
would not have been much less true. But there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
poetry in a biscuit, and precious little sustenance. The gentle
fall of a feather is full of poetry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The day is done, and the darkness</div>
<div class="indent">Falls from the wings of night,</div>
<div class="verse">As a feather is wafted downward</div>
<div class="indent">From an eagle in his flight.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Edgar Allan Poe quoted those lines in his lecture on
The Poetic Principle, and remarked on their insouciance.
Well, he&#8217;s dead.</p>

<p>There are no more memory-vignettes. I have no more
exaltation left. For a certain young woman crossed the
bridge, and she had a baby with her, and a young man
behind her. And she had the impertinence to call the
baby&#8217;s attention to my canoe. Then she spoke winged
words to the infant, and these are the exact winged words
she used:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chickey-chickey-chickey, boatey-boatey-boatey, o-o-m!
Do you love auntey?&#8221;</p>

<p>And she called to the young man, saying, &#8220;&#8217;Enry,
cummere. &#8217;Ere&#8217;s a boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they staggered slowly away, and took my exaltation
with them. Just as I was getting a little better, the wind
set in the wrong direction, and I heard her say some of it
over again.</p>

<p>There is magic in the words. They set a man thinking
of his past, his bills, and things which he has done and
wishes he had left undone. All at once it seems as if it
were going to rain. The wind turns colder. The cushions
of the canoe change to brickbats. Somebody nearly runs
into me, and I drop my pipe, and remember I never posted
that letter after all. I look at my watch, and, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
it&#8217;s stopped. Mainspring broken, probably. The way that
woman talked was enough to destroy the works of a steam-engine.
And I have a twinge in my side which I am quite
sure is heart disease. I had not hoped for Westminster
Abbey quite so soon. &#8220;Deeply lamented. No flowers, by
request.&#8221;</p>

<p>And all this is due to the fearful words which that woman
spoke, or it may be merely reaction. If one gets too high,
or too low, one pays for it afterwards; and the commonplace
praises of <i>aurea mediocritas</i> are properly founded.
The quietist never pays, because he incurs no debts. All
the rest pay, and there is no dun like a Natural Law. It
may agree to renew for a short time, on the consideration
of that small glass of brandy, perhaps, or a week&#8217;s rest; but
one has to pay for the accommodation, and the debt must
be discharged in the end.</p>

<p>Do you remember that quaint old story told by Kapnides
in his third book of Entertainments? Well, Kapnides is
not enough read at Oxford or Cambridge. I doubt if he
is read at all. He is a little artificial, perhaps, but he has
his points. It is the story of a Greek boy.</p>

<p>No; it is not the story of the Spartan boy who lied about
a fox, and subsequently died of the lies which were told
about himself.</p>

<p>It is the story of an Athenian boy, who in the month
of June sat quite alone in a thin tent by night. And the
tent was pitched under the shadow of the long wall, and
the night was hot and stifling.</p>

<p>He sat alone, for dead men are no company. His
father and his eldest brother were in the tent with him;
but he was alone. He had not been afraid to tend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
them in their sickness, for he had himself recovered from
the pestilence; but it had taken away from him his beauty
and his memory. He had been very beautiful, and his
mind had been very full of fair memories. All were gone
now. He kept only the few bare facts which his dying
father had told him, that his mother had died long before;
that they had lived in the country and had been ordered
into the city; that Pericles had made a remarkably fine
speech in the preceding year; and that his only surviving
relation was his twin-brother, who had gone away into
Eub&#339;a with the sheep. On these few poor facts, and on
the two dead manly bodies before him, he pondered as he
sat. And the night grew late, and yet he could hear outside
the tent people passing busily, and quarrels, and long
horrible cries.</p>

<p>And suddenly the poor Greek boy, with the ghost of
an old beauty haunting his dull eyes and scarred cheeks,
looked up, because he was conscious of the presence of a
deity; and there before him sat an old gentleman in a silk
hat, a frock-coat worn shiny under the fore arm, pepper-and-salt
trousers, with a pen stuck at the back of his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I perceive a divine fragrance,&#8221; the boy said. The
fragrance was gin-and-water, but he knew it not. &#8220;And
about thy neck there is a circle of brightness.&#8221; In this
he was correct, because the old gentleman was wearing an
indiarubber dickey covered with luminous paint, which
saves washing and makes it possible to put in a stud in the
dark. &#8220;And thy dress is not like unto mine. It cannot
be but that thou art some god. And at the right time art
thou come; for my heart is heavy, and none but a god can
comfort me. And due worship have I ever rendered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
the gods, but they love me not, and they have taken all
things from me; and only my twin-brother is left, and he
keeps the sheep in Eub&#339;a. And what name dost thou
most willingly hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allow me,&#8221; said the old gentleman, and produced a
card from his pocket, handing it to the boy. On it was
printed:&mdash;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Proleptical Cashier.</span></h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Agent for Zeus &amp; Co., Specialists in Punishments.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The tongue is barbarian,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;and thy
spoken words are barbarian, and yet I understand them;
and now I know that the gods are kinder to me, because
already I have greater wisdom than my fathers, and,
perhaps, somewhat greater remains. Give to me, O
cashier, the power to stay this pestilence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a young &#8217;un,&#8221; said the cashier, &#8220;that&#8217;s pretty
calm, seeing that I <i>made</i> that pestilence. I just want to
go into your little account. Your great-grandpapa, my
boy, incurred a little debt, and Zeus &amp; Co. want the
thing settled before they dissolve partnership. They&#8217;ve
just taken those two lives.&#8221; He touched the body of the
boy&#8217;s father lightly with his foot. &#8220;They&#8217;ve taken your
beauty and your memory. How sweet the girls used to be
on you, my lad! but you can&#8217;t recollect it, and you won&#8217;t
experience it again. You <i>are</i> a bad sight. Now we shall
just kill your brother, and give the sheep the rot, and then
the thing will be square. Now then, it&#8217;s a hot night, and
you&#8217;d better burn these two. I&#8217;ll show you how to do it
on the cheap, without paying for it. As long as Zeus &amp; Co.
are paid I don&#8217;t care about the rest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>The boy sat dazed, and did not speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a rich man built a first-class pyre twenty yards
from your tent. They&#8217;ve gone to fetch his dead daughter
to burn on it. We&#8217;ll collar it before they get back. I&#8217;ll
take the old man, because he&#8217;s the lightest. You carry
your brother. He was a hoplite, wasn&#8217;t he, one of them
gentlemen that do parasangs? Oh, I know all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still the boy did not speak. They took up the two
bodies, passed out of the tent, and laid their burden on
the pyre.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look as if something had hurt you,&#8221; said the old
gentleman. &#8220;I like these shavings miles better than
newspaper.&#8221; He pulled a box of matches from his pocket,
and set light to the pyre. It flared up brightly.</p>

<p>Then the boy touched him on the shoulder, and pointed
first in the direction of Eub&#339;a, and then at himself. A
word came into him from a future civilisation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swop?&#8221; he said gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; grumbled the cashier. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind. It
gives a lot of trouble&mdash;altering the books. But I don&#8217;t
mind, I&#8217;m sure. It&#8217;s a thirsty night.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the boy stood motionless; then, with a
little cry, leapt into the flames. And his life went to join
his beauty and his memory in a land of which we know
too little.</p>

ON SELF-DECEPTION: TOGETHER WITH THE DREAM OF<br />
THE DEAN&#8217;S PREPARATIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS morning, because the air was fresh, and the sun
was bright, and I had eaten too much breakfast, it
seemed to be an excellent thing to cut all lectures and to
loaf in the Backs. Few boats are there in the morning, and
I have found, when my canoe takes me out, that the fewer
the boats the less the unpleasantness. I can run into a
bridge, but a bridge cannot run into me; and a bridge
always takes my apologies in a nice spirit. The afternoon
loafers on the river are not yet sufficiently educated to
understand that a Canadian canoe must go its own way,
and that any attempt to control it is a baseness.</p>

<p>The other afternoon my canoe got a little humorous.
It saw a man on in front of us working hard in one of
those vessels that went a thousand miles down the Jordan&mdash;or
something to that effect. I knew what my canoe would
do. It broke into a canter, caught the absolute stranger
in the back of the neck, and knocked him into the water.
You would have expected the absolute stranger to have
come up, breathing the Englishman&#8217;s Shortest Prayer.
He did not. He apologised for having been in my way,
said that it was entirely his own fault, and hoped that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
had not inconvenienced me. I shrugged my shoulders and
forgave him, with considerable hauteur.</p>

<p>But my boat got Remorse badly. It did not want to
live any more, and tried to knock its brains out against
Clare Bridge. I soothed it, and tied it up. Canadian
canoes are such sensitive things.</p>

<p>This sort of incident cannot happen when one cuts
lectures to go on the river in the morning. And one does
more work. You take your Plato&#8217;s &#8220;Ph&aelig;do,&#8221; and you
really enjoy it. If there&#8217;s any word you don&#8217;t know, you
leave it; if there&#8217;s any sentence you can&#8217;t understand,
you don&#8217;t worry about it; and if there&#8217;s any word you <i>can</i>
understand, it goes home to you more. That&#8217;s the right
spirit. That&#8217;s the way the ancient Greeks took their
language. What did they know about dictionaries and
grammars and cribs? And then, after a couple of minutes,
one pitches the &#8220;Ph&aelig;do&#8221; into the bows of the boat, and
a great Peace falls on one&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>My Better Self does not agree with me on these points;
but I had words with my Better Self this morning, and
since then we have not been on speaking terms. I find
it impossible to convince my Better Self of great truths;
I could deceive my Better Self, which is a common practice,
but I will not do it. I have seen men do it; and I have
been very, very sorry for them. I have known a man, who
had previously been honest, commence to keep an average
of the amount of work he did <i>per diem</i>. The way he faked
that average would have brought a blush to the cheek of
the chartered libertine, and made the chartered accountant
moan for humanity. The first week gave a daily average
of 2 hours 20&middot;5 minutes. In the second week we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
asked to believe that he had done rather more than ten
hours a day. That man drives a cab now: self-deception
never pays. Another man, who was quite a friend of mine,
liked pork chops. He pretended that he didn&#8217;t, and made
himself believe that he didn&#8217;t. Why? Simply and solely
because he once wrote a poem&mdash;and published it&mdash;which
began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Darling, thy hot kiss lingers on my lips.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Before he wrote that poem, he used to feed almost entirely
on pork chops. After it was published, he pretended that
a little ripe fruit was all he needed. What&#8217;s become of
him? What do you suppose? Trichinosis, of course.
It&#8217;s much better to be perfectly honest. The worst case
of all was last May. A man made himself believe that
he loved Bradelby&#8217;s sister, and he never got any better.
He just pined away and married her. Perhaps you don&#8217;t
realise what that means, but you never met Bradelby&#8217;s
sister.</p>

<p>I met her. She sat down at the piano, and stroked it as if
it were a lap-dog. She was quite tender in her movements,
and she sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Once in the deeeeer dead dyes beyond recall.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Shortly afterwards she said that she wanted to live a useful
life. That sort of thing stamps a woman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I suppose I must have been going to sleep when I
thought that last sentence. For I suddenly found myself
in the centre of Epping Forest, and before me was a
college dean in full academicals. He was a leathery
old dean to look at, and yet he had some nervousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
of manner. Of course he was not a real dean, but only
a dream dean. The real deans&mdash;I cannot say it too
emphatically&mdash;are <i>not</i> leathery, and are <i>not</i> nervous.</p>

<p>When he saw me, he began to rub his hands gently and
to smile, until I thought my heart would break.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a little unusual,&#8221; he said; &#8220;a little irregular,
is it not? Have you permission, may I ask, from the
University authorities, to drive a Canadian canoe tandem
through Epping Forest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; I said politely; &#8220;but I was not aware that
permission was required.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Epps&#8217;s Forest,&#8221; he retorted inanely, &#8220;contains absolutely
no fatty matter. Applicants are therefore assured, if they
cannot borrow here, it would be futile to apply elsewhere.
Personal visit invited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir,&#8221; I urged, &#8220;this is a personal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he interrupted me, tapping the palm of one
hand with the forefinger of the other. &#8220;That&#8217;s not the
point, and you know it&#8217;s not the point. I have come
here to practise my part&mdash;Titania&mdash;in <i>Midsummer Night&#8217;s
Dream</i>, with real fairies. I do not do it because I like it.
I do it because I wish to entertain and interest some young
ladies who will be staying with me during the June festivities.
You interrupt my preparations, you frighten the fairies, you
annoy me exceedingly, and your attendance in college chapel
is not what it should be. You&#8217;ve been smoking, and you
smell. Where no allotment is made the deposit will be
returned in full.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not quite make it out, because the dean did not
seem as if he would make up into a good Titania. But
that was the only thing that surprised me. I promised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
sit quite still, and not to frighten the fairies, and entreated
him to go on with the rehearsal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, seating himself on a camp-stool.
&#8220;You will not see the fairies; but you will hear them.
We are now commencing Act II., Scene iii. I give them
their cue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="indent6">Sing me now asleep;</div>
<div class="verse">Then to your offices, and let me rest.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Now, then they sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">You spotted snakes with double tongue.</div>
</div></div>

<p>You know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew it very well; but what the fairies really sang was
this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Fairy.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">You potted slates, disguised as tongue,</div>
<div class="indent">Corn&egrave;d oxen be not seen;</div>
<div class="verse">Such things never put him wrong,</div>
<div class="indent">Never hurt the college dean.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent6">Fill him up with mayonnaise,</div>
<div class="indent6">Made in several different ways;</div>
<div class="verse">(Salmon, chicken mayonnaise; also lobster mayonnaise);</div>
<div class="indent8">Never fear,</div>
<div class="indent8">&#8217;Twill keep him queer,</div>
<div class="indent6">Shocking queer for several days;</div>
<div class="indent6">He <i>can&#8217;t</i> work on mayonnaise.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Second Fairy.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Curried rabbits, come not nigh;</div>
<div class="indent">Hence, tomato-tinners, hence!</div>
<div class="verse">He can eat what you or I</div>
<div class="indent">Wouldn&#8217;t for a hundred pence.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Chorus as before.</i>)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;There,&#8221; exclaimed the dean, turning to me, &#8220;that goes
pretty well, I think. Shakespeare would be pleased. I shall
play <i>Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</i> on the first night of the
visit of my lady friends. On the second night I am going
to sing them some songs. On the third night I shall give
a conjuring entertainment.&#8221; He suddenly stopped, and
burst into tears. &#8220;And on the fourth night,&#8221; he sobbed,
&#8220;their funeral will take place, and they are so young and
fair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you fix their funeral for the first night?&#8221; I
asked. &#8220;They&#8217;d suffer less so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the dean firmly, &#8220;they must be amused first&mdash;amused
and interested and entertained. And I must
amuse them, and I never amused any one in my life before.
I can&#8217;t take them to the races, because there are undergraduates
about. I can&#8217;t take them to dances for similar
reasons. I&#8217;m going to do it all myself.&#8221; He burst out
sobbing again. &#8220;And I know it will kill them. The
fairies won&#8217;t play out of Epping Cocoa, so I shall have to
undertake every character in the piece. Now I must go
back, and practise my songs. I am <i>so</i> anxious to be
amusing. It quite weighs on my mind. You don&#8217;t know
anything that would do for the conjuring entertainment, do
you? Card-tricks, you know, or think-of-any-number-you-like,
or something of that sort?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said these words he got into my boat, which
started down a river that flowed into a drawing-room. We
got out. Then the boat changed into a piano, and the
dean sat down to it, and began to play the symphony.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of those simple, touching songs, and it&#8217;s called
&#8216;Papa.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Then he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Take my head on your shoulders, papa,</div>
<div class="indent">Let&#8217;s have it back when you&#8217;ve done;</div>
<div class="verse">I only unscrewed it in jest, papa&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">Only unscrewed it in fun.</div>
<div class="verse">And it&#8217;s pleasant to lie and to think, papa,</div>
<div class="indent">You can give it me back all right;</div>
<div class="verse">My head, though it&#8217;s screwed, is loose, papa,</div>
<div class="indent">And you, when you&#8217;re screwed, are tight.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t possibly sing that to the ladies,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;I&#8217;ve kept the words a little too
long, and the weather&#8217;s been hot. I&#8217;ll try another&mdash;a
fervent and passionate one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; I said firmly, and jumped into the
piano, which changed into the canoe again, and started
away down the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the wrong &#8217;bus!&#8221; the dean shrieked after me.
He shrieked so loudly that he woke me. At least, he
half woke me. I was so full of the idea that I was in the
wrong &#8217;bus that I got out. The canoe was in the middle
of the river at the time. You will find an excellent edition
of Plato&#8217;s &#8220;Ph&aelig;do,&#8221; a copy of last week&#8217;s <i>Review</i>, and my
nicest pipe at the bottom of the river in King&#8217;s. At any
rate, you may go and dive for them if you like.</p>

ON REFLECTION; TO WHICH IS ADDED THE STORY OF<br />
THE TIN HEART.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;LIKE to watch those trees reflected in the water.
They are so suggestive, by reason of their being
reflected wrong way up. All objective, outside facts are
as trees, and the mind of man is as a river, and he consequently
reflects everything in an inverted way. That is
the reason why, if I try to guess a coin and say heads, it
is always tails. That is the reason why, if I go to get a
spoon out of my plate-basket in the dark, I always take
out thirteen successive forks before I find one. It explains
nearly everything. Probably the correct way to dine is
really to begin with the fruit and end with the oysters.
Itinerant musicians should begin by making a collection
and leave out the other part. Anything that <i>can</i> be done
backwards is better done backwards. When I leave for a
moment the presence of royalty I am always required to
walk backwards. That shows that royalty, together with
Her Privy Council, which is the collected wisdom of the
nation, thinks that it is best to walk backwards. And so it
is. It is not only happier and holier, but it is also more
piquant. You can never tell until you&#8217;ve kicked it whether
you have backed into a policeman or a lamp-post. New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
possibilities are open to you. Anything may happen, and
generally does. So, too, in skating. A good skater told
me that the only enjoyable method of progression is the
outside edge backwards. &#8220;It makes you feel like a bird,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;and I don&#8217;t believe you can get that sensation of
flight any other way.&#8221; He simply seemed to float on the
ice. You see, he was a good skater. At last he galumphed
into a snow-heap, flew just like a bird for a few yards, then
came down hard and hurt a lady. Look at these railway
collisions, too. We all know what an awful thing a railway
collision is: and how does it always happen? It happens
from two trains wanting to go to the same spot and arriving
there simultaneously. If both trains had respectively
reversed their directions, no collision could have happened.
A train should never be allowed to go anywhere, but only to
<i>back</i> to the place whence it came. But, as I should like these
pages to be of solid, material use to any young men who
are really trying to lead the philosophical life, and are quite
earnest in their desire to avoid the Scylla of action without
falling into the Charybdis of thought, I will put my facts and
deductions clearly and briefly. The facts are two:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) That a tree is reflected in the water wrong way up.</p>

<p>(2) That the reflection of such a reflection would be
right way up.</p>

<p>From No. 2 we deduce that the best literary method
is to crib some other man&#8217;s ideas or reflections; and this
is what I always do when I write an article.</p>

<p>From No. 1 we deduce that as all reflection is the
reverse of the thing reflected, it is best to act altogether
without reflection; and this is what the editor always does
when he prints my articles; and what you yourselves do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
when you pay two-and-sixpence for this volume in spite of
it.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, my dear old sympathetic canoe has
been going slowly backwards on its own account, and must
be stopped.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was only the other night that I took my canoe out
in the moonlight, when the river is solitary and quiet. I
shall not take it by night any more, because it is too
sympathetic. A man came and leaned over one of the
bridges and watched the reflection of the spangled skies in
the ripple. He sighed, and said, &#8220;Pree lil starsh!&#8221; Then
he swore hard at them. Then he sighed again, and his
cap tumbled off into the water. &#8220;Ish all over now,&#8221; he
said solemnly, and walked wearily away. My boat simply
shuddered. I could feel it shudder.</p>

<p>After that it got absurdly sentimental. Now I hate and
I despise sentiment. I suppose it was the effect of the
moonlight. It made some verses. At least I suppose the
boat made them. I found them in my blazer pocket
afterwards, and I&#8217;m sure I recognised the handwriting.
So I will give them in full. (You will do nothing of the
kind.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to discuss the merit of those verses.
There may be something in them which the world will one
day learn to cherish, or there may not be; but I deprecate
the weakness and sentimentality which cause verse. We
want to be strong, really strong. We want more of the
spirit of that Gallic chieftain who wanted a tin heart made
for himself. The story is well enough known, and you will
find it in Livy: it is in one of the lost books; but I give it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
for the benefit of readers who are not classical. I do not
scorn such readers. I can remember the time when I
had not the finished scholarship, the critical insight, the
almost insolent familiarity with the more recondite parts
of history, which&mdash;with all modesty be it spoken&mdash;I know
that I now possess.</p>

<p>I have forgotten some of the names, all the dates, and a
few of the facts. But these are not the essentials. Such
things are but the dry bones of history. We want the
flesh and blood and sinews&mdash;the words, the large, beautiful,
vague words that smudge over a difficulty until you can&#8217;t
see it.</p>

<p>To understand why the Gallic Chieftain wanted a tin
heart, we must first of all appreciate the man&#8217;s character.</p>

<p>When the Gallic tribe, to which he belonged, formed
one of their sudden plans (<i>Gallorum subita sunt consilia</i>),
he was always in the front of the battle; but when he
was at home he used to smoke his pipe in the back yard,
because his wife and her mother would not allow it in
the house. He had plenty of fighting courage, but no
domestic courage. And there were other points in which he
saw that he was weak. Sometimes, for instance, he found
some aged veteran in the streets, in a state of destitution,
with a card on his breast to say that he had lost his wife
in a colliery explosion, selling <i>sulfura</i>, or playing on the
<i>tuba telescopica</i>, an instrument resembling the trombone,
but more deleterious. Whenever this happened, he would
buy the matches, or give the man money. It was weak of
him, but he couldn&#8217;t help it.</p>

<p>The tribe to which he belonged was transcendental,
heterodox, habitually untruthful, and characterised by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
belief that the affections resided in the heart. So, when
this poor chieftain found that he was getting too good and
kind (ah, how many of us have felt like that!&mdash;I often
have), he concluded that something must be wrong with
his heart, and went to a medicine man or <i>fakir</i>. And he
said: &#8220;O fakir, would you fake me up a tin heart? For
the heart which I have is too unpleasantly soft, and I want
a metal one.&#8221; The fakir agreed to make the change for
twelve ducats. But just at this time an accident happened
to the budget of this tribe, and a tax of ten ducats per
pound was put on <i>plumbum album</i>&mdash;no, my boy, not white
lead: it means tin. So it was quite clear to the fakir that
he could not afford to give the man a tin heart, and yet he
had signed the document. Besides, he wanted those twelve
ducats.</p>

<p>So he gave the man chloroform, removed his heart, and
then proceeded to do his best with a cheap substitute.
But the cheap substitute refused to be faked, and the fakir
was still hard at work trying to make something which
should do quite as well as a tin heart and last longer, when
he noticed signs of reviving consciousness in the chieftain.
He had no more chloroform to give him, and no time to
lose. So he hurriedly sewed up the incision, and left the
man with no heart at all, neither of flesh, nor of tin, nor
of cheap substitute.</p>

<p>Then the chieftain started off home, and he looked very
cheerful indeed. He tripped up two blind men, and threw
their <i>sulfura</i> down a grating. Then he went into a public-house,
and spent his week&#8217;s <i>stipendium</i>. Finally, he reeled
home, kicked his wife, smoked two cigars in the drawing-room,
broke his mother-in-law&#8217;s head, forgot to wipe his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
boots, said he wanted some tea, and went to sleep with his
feet on the crimson plush mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Now, next day another Gaul was going down the street
when he saw two goats being harnessed to a milk-cart. It
at once occurred to him that it would be as well to throw
off the Roman yoke. So another insurrection was started,
and the Gallic chieftain who had no heart was put in the
forefront of the battle.</p>

<p>Just as the trumpets sounded for a charge, this Gallic
chieftain remembered that he had left his handkerchief in
the tent, and went to look for it in a hurry, and got himself
disliked. But as the rest of the tribe were mostly
killed in the charge, he did not mind that much. The
survivors said: &#8220;Our noble chief has begun to be a coward.&#8221;
But he was not afraid of his wife, and used bad language
in her presence during mealtimes. One of the survivors
went so far as to run a lance through the place where
the chieftain&#8217;s heart ought to have been. The chieftain
smiled, and said sarcastically that he was not an umbrella-stand.</p>

<p>Death is connected with the stoppage of the heart&#8217;s
action; consequently this chieftain never died, and it is
argued that during the Syro-Ph&#339;nician attempt to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here there is a hiatus in the manuscript. A scribe has
added a note in the margin <i>pallido atramento</i>, &#8220;The chieftain
is still alive. I have seen him. I have written his
name at the foot of the manuscript.&#8221; I have looked there,
and simply found the words &#8220;<i>Venditus iterum</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the other day I bought a cigar which was all case
and no inwards. The tobacconist who sold it me said it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
was a Regalia Gallica; and he looked as if he had been in
this world a long time, and had seen the wickedness of it.
I simply mention this as a coincidence. There may be
nothing in it, like the cigar. But it is a curious case, if
nothing else&mdash;also like the cigar.</p>

A STORM ON THE BACKS; AND A STORY OF THREE.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;HAVE often considered it as one of my misfortunes
that I simply do not know what fear is. As a boy I
was so brave and bright that every one loved me; in my
manhood my courage appals me. I feel that one day it will
carry me too far.</p>

<p>As I climbed hand-over-hand up the side of the <i>Zeitgeist</i> at
the Silver Street Docks, an old, old sailor stepped up to me.
&#8220;Young stranger,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you will not attempt to make
King&#8217;s Bridge on such a day as this? It would be madness.
The boldest of us dare not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Avaunt!&#8221; I cried; &#8220;where honour calls I follow. England
expects. <i>Per ardua ad astra.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away to hide his emotion. I gave him my
hand, which he wrung and knocked twice. There was no
answer.</p>

<p>With one wild, exultant leap the vessel burst from its
moorings, churning the iron-bound waves to sheer desperation,
foaming at the mouth, and sobbing piteously.
Through the driving rain, the blinding fog, the dazzling
lightning, the impenetrable mist, and the other atmospheric
phenomena which Mr. Clark Russell had lent for the
occasion, loomed a hideous dark object. I consulted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
chart, the compass, the telescope, the ship&#8217;s biscuits, everything
I could lay my hands on; but it was too late. Nearer
and nearer it loomed. I could see that it was Silver
Street Bridge, <i>and that it was coming my way</i>. Oh, the
horror of it!</p>

<p>I shrieked to it to save itself and go away. But my voice
was drowned in the fury of the elements. It loomed nearer&mdash;it
never stopped looming once&mdash;and I knew that I should
be unable to avoid it, that I should destroy it.</p>

<p>Bump! From the top of the bridge there came the
voice of a small boy, asking if I was insured. He seemed
hysterical, and fear had probably sapped his reason. I was
swept on by the fury of the elements. No, I&#8217;ve just had
that&mdash;swept on by the elemental fury&mdash;well, that&#8217;s much the
same.</p>

<p>At any rate, I was swept on. The wind whistled in the
rigging, until it got sick of being conventional. Then it
went and whistled in the taffrail. At last it got so nastily
original that it sang &#8220;Since first I saw your Face&#8221; in the
binnacle. A hasty glance backward showed me that Silver
Street Bridge was yet standing. My resolution was also
unshaken.</p>

<p>The fierce old Berserker spirit fired my blood. Chanting
aloud the grand old Latin hymn of the Crusaders&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A, ab, absque, coram, de,</div>
<div class="verse">Palam, clam, cum, ex and e&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>I dashed forward. My speed may be guessed from the fact
that by this time I was under Queen&#8217;s Bridge. Before me,
or close behind me, or at any rate on one side or the other,
lowered in thick banks of cloud an angry sun, red as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
blood of an orange that the thunder had pealed! The waves
were mountain high.</p>

<p>The light of the unbroken Viking was in my eyes. I
could not see them, but I knew that it must be so. The
waves were mounting higher now.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wind shifted. It became semicircular,
with a pendulum action. It swung my boat round to
the left, then swung it round to the right. It kept on
doing this. A horrible thought flashed across me that I
should never make King&#8217;s Bridge at this rate. I said
&#8220;Excelsior&#8221; to the boat to encourage it, but it only went on
wagging. I smote it on the bows with the flat of my paddle,
and that had no effect. Lastly, I raised myself about four
inches, and sat down again with the energy and directness
of the wild Norsemen. The jerk started it on again. We
went so fast that a sparrow seemed to be literally flying past
me. I believe that was what it actually <i>was</i> doing. By this
time the waves were quite extraordinary.</p>

<p>We were now but a few yards from home. There was
another change in the weather. The sun was like a
crystal chalice brimming with crimson wine, borne by an
unseen Ganymede to his lord across the sapphire pavement
of cloud. (Poetry is cheap to-day.) Had his white
feet slipped on the wondrous far-off way? For of a sudden
the crimson flood suffused the sapphire floor, and the gasp
of the dying wind was as of one who cried, &#8220;Come away
in my &#8217;and, sir, and it was cracked before, and you didn&#8217;t
ought to have left it there, and I never touched it, and &#8217;ow
was I to know yer didn&#8217;t want it broke?&#8221; Then the wind
sank. My boat was motionless. I was becalmed within
sight of my goal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>So I waited in the middle of the river. The storm was
passed, and the waves were perfectly calm and collected,
like a bad halfpenny in an offertory bag. There was not
a breath of wind, and consequently the first two matches
which I lit were blown out at once. The third match did
what was expected of it, and then I attempted to blow <i>it</i> out.
Finding this impossible, I threw it in the water. It floated
on the top, and burnt with a clear steady flame for ten
consecutive minutes. While I was watching it I let my pipe
out, and had to strike a fourth match. The head came off
it, and nestled lovingly in the palm of my hand. Then it
walked away, and burned two holes in my blazer. How
such little incidents as this make one wish that the nature
of things was otherwise!</p>

<p>I may own that I never did make King&#8217;s Bridge that
afternoon. My canoe did not seem to care about going
there of its own accord, and I did not like to paddle it there
because I hate unnecessary fuss; so I just stopped where I
was and read a little.</p>

<p>What was I reading?</p>

<p>Well, I had his book, you know, after his death. Some
of it interests me; but this is chiefly because I knew the
man. He wrote it as a remedy, and he died as a remedy;
but I have a notion that he is not quite cured yet. I
take the book here to read sometimes. You may see a
page or two of it. I am not pretending that it has any
literary value But try to think you knew the man who
wrote it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She shivered a little as she sat there in her nightdress.
In the small hours of the morning in early summer it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
always cold. She would have been much warmer in bed;
she really ought to have been in bed; but the bed had not
been slept in. It stood there in one corner of the room,
looking white and restful. It seemed to be calling her,
&#8220;Come to me; sleep and forget it&mdash;sleep and forget it.&#8221;
On the little table at the foot of the bed was the pile of
books and newspapers that had slowly accumulated. She
had always been interested in the world and in the things
others did and thought.</p>

<p>A little impulse that came to her from nowhere made
her pick up the newspaper that lay on the top of the pile.
It would do to fill her mind and to keep her thoughts
steady until the morning came. Her eyes ached, and the
candles flickered on the dressing-table. Her brain seemed
to her as a pool into which some thoughtless child that
did what he liked had flung a stone, starting circle after
circle, circles that grew and grew, spreading to the farther
edge, and sobbing away into nothing because they could go
no farther. Yet she read, and knew nothing of what she
read, till one sentence seemed to shine brighter than the
rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The body had probably been in the water for several
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood up quickly, with a little gasp, and let the
newspaper fall to the ground. For her brain, burning
with torture and want of sleep, had suddenly flashed out a
merciless, truthful, coloured illustration to that sentence.
She steadied herself in a moment. Then she held up her
hands and looked at them. &#8220;Will they turn like that?&#8221;
she was asking herself. She shivered, and the muscles of
her face contracted a little.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>She was bending now over the mantelpiece. Her arms
and her burning forehead rested upon it, and her thoughts
went stealing away through the passages and rooms of the
quiet old house. In the room next to hers slept stolid
respectability. She loved him and her, as the accident of
parentage makes love. But she must leave them. How
she hated to hurt those two, those kind, misunderstanding
parents, with their old ideas, and their love for her ever
fresh! No, she could not leave them, she could not leave
them. &#8220;You will leave them at dawn,&#8221; said the thing that
was stronger than herself.</p>

<p>And her thoughts stood mutely listening outside the door
of the room where Claud lay. &#8220;Are you asleep?&#8221; she
whispered. Or was he lying awake and thinking, as she
thought, of the night before? It all came back to her so
easily,&mdash;the wistful refrain that lingered softly on the strings,
the brilliant lights and the brilliant crowd, and suddenly
the dim garden outside the ball-room. She could see him
standing there; she could hear him speaking. No, she
could never, never leave him. &#8220;You will leave him at
dawn,&#8221; said the thing that was stronger than herself.</p>

<p>And the dawn had come now.</p>

<p>She drew up the blind, and opened the window softly.
The sky was one dull grey but for the beauty in the east.
A fresh, cool wind had awakened; and she could hear the
chirrup, chirrup of waking birds. And she looked down
the valley and saw the hurrying, winding river, with the
grey mists hovering upon it. &#8220;River,&#8221; she said in a
whisper, &#8220;take me to the sea. Take me to a sea that has
no shores, that will flow for ever, bearing me farther and
farther away from this.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>She crept down the stairs, bare-footed, and into the
drawing-room. She drew back the heavy curtains from
the windows that opened down to the ground. Outside
was the terraced garden that sloped down to the edge of
the river. Her hand was on the bolt of the window.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard quick footsteps coming down the
passage. In a moment she had hidden herself behind
the screen that stood against the door. She knew those
footsteps. Involuntarily her hands linked tightly together,
and her breath came quickly.</p>

<p>He was not so careful as she had been; he came boldly
into the room, opened the window noisily, and went out
into the garden. As he went out she caught one glimpse
of his face, and she knew what he would do. She sprang
from behind the screen. &#8220;Claud, Claud!&#8221; she called.
He stopped with a sudden start, and came towards her.
&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; he asked, in a voice that was
not like his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I,&#8221; she panted&mdash;&#8220;I came to save you, Claud. Oh, go
back again!&#8221;</p>

<p>He would have taken her hands, but she shrank away
from him. They only stayed there for a few minutes.
She talked to him and pleaded with him. There was little
need for such pleading, for he had yielded to her from the
first. He gave her the only promise that she would let him
make, and then he went back to his room.</p>

<p>She quietly closed the windows, and drew the curtains
again. She seemed to herself both sad and happy now,
and very tired.</p>

<p>And Fate had an approving smile upon her bitter face.
&#8220;They are two obedient children,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
going to take matters into their own hands, and they resisted
the temptation. Very well, they shall be rewarded.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Fate sent the girl a present of a beautiful brain-fever
with pictures in it. And when it was over she fell asleep,
and dreamed that she was floating on a sea that had no
shores and flowed for ever, bearing her farther and farther
away from this. And she woke no more.</p>

<p>And Fate thought that she should then do something
for Claud. So she killed another woman, and killed her
with thirty other people in a railway accident, thereby
escaping any charge of impartial justice. They both had
loved him, and they were both dead, and he got much
happier. In the unprepared passages of this life a glimpse
at the context would be useful.</p>

ON LOAFING; TOGETHER WITH A SECOND ANECDOTE FROM<br />
THE ENTERTAINMENTS OF KAPNIDES.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;TOOK my canoe the other day up that part of the river
where only Masters of Arts are allowed to drown themselves
without a certificate. None of them were doing it on
the day I was there, and it was rather dull, and the boat
went to sleep with its cold nose resting on the soft grass
that edged the river.</p>

<p>So I just stopped there and lazed, and watched other
boats go past. There is a prevalent notion apparently that
nothing which is said in one boat can possibly be heard
in another. As each boat went past, its occupants made
humorous and uncomplimentary remarks upon me. The
waiters in some of the inferior London restaurants have a
similar notion that nobody understands French. Without
these little delusions we should not be as happy as we are.
In my case there seemed to be an idea that I had got stuck
in the bank and couldn&#8217;t get out again. The impression
was wrong. My boat was a little tired, and went to sleep.
It had come a long way, and I was not brute enough to
wake it up again.</p>

<p>I watched the other boats go past. There were very fine
and noble people in some of them, but I did not see one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
proper loafer, and hardly any one who had elementary
notions of the right way to loaf. There is no subject which
is less understood. The spirit of asceticism, the spirit of
extravagance for its own sake, and the spirit of utilitarianism
are fast spoiling us.</p>

<p>The popular idea that loafing is in some way connected
with laziness should be removed. Loafing is the science
of living without trouble. There may be a time when it
is easier to work than to laze. A man, when suffering
badly from Tripos, may find it less trouble to read Thucydides
than to stifle his conscience. The condition of mind
is unhealthy and morbid; but, where it exists, it would
certainly be better loafing to work than to laze. And no
one objects more than the well-trained loafer to enforced
laziness. When he is in London he will have his hat
ironed at the barber&#8217;s rather than at the maker&#8217;s. In the
first case he will have to pay for it, but he will be shaved
while it is being done; in the second case no charge is
made, but more than sixpennyworth of vitality is consumed
in the irritation of having to wait. It is not the waiting
which the loafer minds: it is the <i>having</i> to wait.</p>

<p>There are many who would loaf, but fail from want
of a little thought. They do not take enough trouble to
avoid trouble. They arrive at some result, and half a loaf
is better than no bread; but nevertheless they do not get
the perfect life.</p>

<p>Here is a problem in loafing.</p>

<p>There were four men&mdash;A, B, C, D&mdash;who rose one
morning, and all found they wanted shaving.</p>

<p>A was too lazy, left his chin as it was, was miserable
all that day, and simply <i>had</i> to shave next day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>B half-way through the morning got shaved at a
barber&#8217;s.</p>

<p>C conquered his inclinations and shaved himself at
once.</p>

<p>D, knowing that it was impossible to grow a beard at
Cambridge, and being too lazy to shave or be shaved, had
his things packed up, and &#8220;went down.&#8221;</p>

<p>The vanity of the man, the strength of the beard, and
the distance from a barber are the same in each case; and
it is supposed that the price of a shave is so small that
it may be disregarded: which was the best loafer of the
four?</p>

<p>There was not a perfect loafer among them, but the best
was undoubtedly C, and the next best was D. This will
seem strange to any one who has not studied the effect of
anticipation on happiness and the reverse. Nothing is real
to us except our imagination of it. What would the perfect
loafer have done? I know; and you, my sympathetic
reader, know. But I do not think any of the others do.
And it would be of no use to tell them, because they would
not believe it. The answer is too long and elaborate to
be given in any case.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that loafing is not the science
of living for pleasure, which is foolishness, but the science
of living without trouble. We may believe, as it is said in
&#8220;The New Republic,&#8221; that one of the two most lasting
pleasures is the pleasure of saying a neat thing neatly;
yet the perfect loafer will never become a conversationalist.</p>

<p>But it is of little use to preach. After all I have said
about the quantity of cushions necessary for comfort in a
Canadian canoe, I constantly see men going out with far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
too few. I am always hearing complaints that we are not
taught engineering or some other horribly useful thing.
But why are we not taught the art of perfect living, which
is loafing?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Only a few out of my many books do I ever bring on the
water. Some of the best would seem quite out of place.
To-day I&#8217;ve got that curious old translation of the &#8220;Entertainments
of Kapnides&#8221; with me. I was reminded of it by
seeing those children going along in the meadow, picking
flowers. Of course you know the story well enough, but I
cannot be bothered to be original in every chapter. It is
the story of the Child Siren.</p>

<p>Ligeia never cared about the child from the first. It
interfered with business. It absolutely refused to play her
accompaniments, and said it could not bear to see the
sailors tempted to their death. On this particular day it
had interrupted Ligeia just as she reached the most tender,
pathetic, touching part of her song. The sob of the child
broke into the sloppy waltz refrain, and spoiled the spell.
And the helmsman had turned the ship&#8217;s prow out again
from the coast, and there was another crew gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sinful little beast,&#8221; said Ligeia. &#8220;Get out of my
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child was not sorry to go. She climbed up the cliff,
and then wandered on away from the sea, where the long
grass came up to her waist. And as she wandered, the sun
shone brightly, and the cool wind blew into her hair, and
the birds sang above her, and only a little distance away
sounded the drowsy murmurs of the waves.</p>

<p>And then for the first time in her life the passion for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
song came into her. She felt that she <i>must</i> sing. Always
before she had shuddered at the thought of song, for the
song of Ligeia and others had ever brought death with it.
But now she felt that she <i>must</i> sing, and she knew not
why; for a study of hereditary tendencies was not included
in the Board School education of that period. She had
reached an open space now. The ground was sandy, with
here and there a stunted clump of grass, and in one place a
beautiful golden poppy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one will hear me,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;and if I do not
sing my heart will break.&#8221; So she sang, standing there
white and naked, with the sunlight upon her, holding a lyre
in her little hands.</p>

<p>And the music came out of her soul, but she knew not
whence the words came.</p>

<p>She sang that it was not sweet for the golden poppy to
bloom there alone, though the sun made it warm, and the
wind was fragrant about it. It was sweeter that she should
pluck it in her little hands, which were warm with a better
life than the life of the sun, and more fragrant than the
west wind with its burden of the breath of the flowers.
She paused, and her fingers rested lightly on the lyre.
Her eyes were strained in looking up to the east, and she
did not see that the poppy had bowed its golden head and
withered away.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is not sweet,&#8221; she sang again, &#8220;for you, white
bird, to fly on and on, and never to rest. It is better to
lie here, and let me touch you, and fondle you, and love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And out from the eastern sky flew the white bird, and it
nestled for one moment at the child&#8217;s breast, and then fell
dead on the sand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>And the child saw what she had done, and she flung
herself down beside the dead bird and the withered flower,
and sobbed in the foolishest way.</p>

<p>So the afternoon wore on, and the sea still murmured,
and she still lay there. And when it was evening a new
wind sprang up from the south, and it whispered to
her,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl&#8217;s voice for a bird&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood up, erect, with eyes that flashed brightly,
though the tears still stood in them. She held the white
bird in her little hands. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you my voice,&#8221; she
said, as she kissed it. And the bird flew far away from
her, and the girl was dumb.</p>

<p>For a little while she stood there, and the old passion
of song came back to her, and tore at her heart; but she
could not sing, for she was dumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have nothing else left,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;with
which I may give back the life to the golden poppy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crimson for golden,&#8221; the south wind called softly in
her ear.</p>

<p>So she lay down once more, and put her pretty mouth to
the dead bloom of the poppy, and she could not speak, but
she thought the words&mdash;&#8220;Drink my blood! Drink my life,
and live!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the dead flower drained out her life, and she grew
white and whiter, and when the moonlight fell upon her,
not a tint of colour was in her cheeks.</p>

<p>Out of the forest the south wind crept, and he seemed
a little excited as he saw the dead girl lying there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never do it again,&#8221; he swore; &#8220;if they want such
things done, they must do them themselves. Curse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
them!&#8221; Then he howled, for his masters had overheard
him and chastised him.</p>

<p>He went back to the forest, and brooded all day over
what had happened. And that night he went mad, and
came forth to do one or two things on his own account.
There was the tall poppy growing by the head of the dead
girl, and it had become crimson.</p>

<p>The south wind gave one puff, and blew it out of the
ground into the sea.</p>

<p>And over the child&#8217;s body it blew the finest white sand
that it could find, until a heavy drift lay over it.</p>

<p>And it went away to a lonely place where a solitary tree
was standing, and in the tree sat the white bird in her
nest. And he blew down the tree, and broke the nest, and
chased the bird for days and days over the water, till at last
the bird sank.</p>

<p>And still the wind was not satisfied. He had a faint
idea that he had not been doing much good. He ought,
by rights, to have killed his masters. He knew that, but
his masters could not be killed. How they smiled as they
sat up in cloudland, and watched their angry servant
snarling over a child, a bird, and a flower! &#8220;He&#8217;s not
satisfied,&#8221; said the first. &#8220;Very few people are,&#8221; grunted
a second. &#8220;You&#8217;re right there,&#8221; snorted a third. Their
conversation rarely rose above the intellectual level of a
market ordinary; but they had the power, and could afford
to be a little dull at times.</p>

ON CAUSES; WITH AN EXCURSION ON LUCK.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;HAVE just been lunching with a man. He is either a
Socialist or a Vegetarian&mdash;I forget which. On second
thoughts, he cannot have been a Vegetarian, because he
ate cutlets. He may have been a Philatelist; but I doubt
it, and I do not fancy that it really matters. He was something&mdash;one
of those things that make a man want to lead a
higher life, and collar most of the conversation. He told
me a good deal about it, and I know that at the time I
thought it was a fine thing and an interesting thing; and
I wondered why more of us did not do it; and yet I&#8217;ve
forgotten what it was. The main point, however, is not
what he was, but the fact that he was something. He
had a Cause, an Enthusiasm; something that lifted him
above the common ruck, something he could brag about,
something that made it necessary for him to fill up papers,
and sign declarations, and feel as if the nation had purchased
him at his own price.</p>

<p>The jilted are bitter on the subject of women; the fox
was malicious about the grapes that he could not reach;
Tantalus was often heard to remark that undiluted water
was not worth drinking. If a man sneer at Causes, it is
because he himself has not any Cause; and the sneer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
is idle, because he might have many Causes if he liked.
A man may be so poor that he has no effects; but he may
still have a Cause. Some of them require a subscription
of one shilling; but with more it suffices that a man shall
bother half a crown out of his friend. So, as the sneer is
not required for the consolation of the sneerer, it must
therefore be quite pointless and unprejudiced.</p>

<p>Personally, I must own that I have no Cause at present.
I loaf. I am utterly selfish. But I am going to select
one soon, because I feel sure that it will elevate me.
Besides, I do not see why I should be bored to death by
those of my friends who happen to be cracked&mdash;quite
cracked&mdash;about some glorious ideal, and never be able
to return their unkindness. Reciprocity is the rule of
life. You brag to me about your picture gallery for the
starving poor, and I feel at once that I must lie to you
about thought-transference. It is partly because I am just
about to ruin a Cause by my support that I feel so angry
with those selfish, flippant, trivial people who sneer at
Causes. The worst point in the sneer is its impartiality.
We do not want cold, hard, uncoloured criticism with its
shameful want of bias. We want warm, tender, muddle-headed
enthusiasm, that does not quibble about merit or
demerit, that tinges the mere critical faculty with good
feeling or bad feeling as the case may be, that is full of
humanity which is pigheadedness. But no amount of
sneers will prevent me from selecting a Cause to which I
may devote my life. The only thing which is likely to
prevent me is the difficulty of selection. There are so
many Causes, and they are all so good. Shall I be a
Philanthropist? Help the poor, and you help yourself. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Philanthropist is the mainstay of the nation. Or shall I be
a Dipsomaniac? Help yourself, and pass the bottle. The
Dipsomaniac is the mainstay of the Budget. It would be
difficult to choose even between these two. The Dipsomaniac
sacrifices more than the Philanthropist, and he is
less self-conscious; but, on the other hand, the Philanthropist
is more popular and less truthful. If it be a
fine thing to help the poor, is it not an equally fine thing
to help the dear Budget? Perhaps the main distinction
between the two is that the Dipsomaniac accounts for
most of the rum, and the Philanthropist is mostly rum
in his accounts. But who can possibly decide the difference
in their merits? And these are but two: there are
thousands of others.</p>

<p>There once was a cuckoo-clock bird; and after the
manner of cuckoos it did not lay wind-eggs in its own
nest. It deposited them in a mare&#8217;s nest, and a stuffed
ph&#339;nix hatched them dead on the Greek Kalends of
April. It was thought at the time that the mechanical,
the impossible, and the futile had never been so beautifully
combined. Yet I have seen a man repeat the lessons that
the last pamphlet had wound him up to say, deposit a
handsome donation of his father&#8217;s money in the society
that published it, crow to all his friends and expect to
see the world regenerated. The combination was quite
as beautiful, and yet people sneer at Causes! What
great general ever lived who had not this, or a similar
faculty for combination? And though the things combined
may be utterly bad in themselves, we should never
forget how very much of them we get for our money&mdash;or
our father&#8217;s money, as the case may be.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>But it is of little use to speak. There are few men in
the world who have a Cause. We are not serious enough.
We give our minds to all manner of trifles. With the
exception of yourself, perhaps, I believe that I am the
only man left who really wants a Cause and is unable to
find one. With the rest it is sheer selfishness.</p>

<p>See me hit that fly on my boat&#8217;s nose. Flop. Missed
it. All right, you wait till it comes back again.</p>

<p>It seems to have aggravated that fly. It has left the
boat&#8217;s nose and gone for mine. I wonder if it knows
that I do not like to hit my own nose hard: instinct is a
marvellous thing in insects. Or it may simply be luck:
luck is quite as marvellous.</p>

<p>I knew a man once who wanted to do serious good until
luck spoilt him. He was fond of whist, and he played a
good&mdash;University-good&mdash;rubber; but he felt that it was
not profiting the world, and that he should like to feel
that he was working for humanity when he was playing
for sixpenny points.</p>

<p>And, firstly, it struck him that it would be a good thing
to put a small tax on trumps, and help the dear Budget.
He wrote to his uncle about it, because his uncle was
in the House, and had once picked an earwig off Mr.
Gladstone&#8217;s coat, and had a good deal of influence. His
uncle wrote back to say that it was a good idea, and that
he had given it his earnest consideration; but that it was
impracticable, because the tax would be too difficult to collect.</p>

<p>And, at the same time, his aunt sent him a collecting-box
for the Servants&#8217; Home in Tasmania, and asked him
to place it in a prominent position in his rooms and do his
best for it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>So it occurred to him that here was a chance for him to
impose a voluntary tax upon himself, and make his whist
do some serious good. He made a vow, and repeated it
aloud in these words:&mdash;&#8220;I vow that the next time I have
five trumps I will put half a crown in the collecting-box for
the Servants&#8217; Home in Tasmania.&#8221; He told me afterwards
that if the experiment had turned out well he had intended
to repeat it, and do a good deal in one way or another for
the Tasmanian servants. He also called my attention to
the wording of the vow, which he said was important.
That very night he sat down to a rubber, and started by
dealing himself five trumps. They were the five lowest
trumps; but my friend was surprised and pleased at the
coincidence, stole softly from his place, dropped half a
crown into the collecting-box on the mantelpiece, and
returned without saying anything.</p>

<p>As it happened, one of his opponents had the remaining
eight trumps, and not one of my friend&#8217;s five made a
trick. Ultimately he lost two trebles and the rub. It
was then that he recalled the exact wording of his vow.
Of course it is not an easy thing to break the bottom out
of a collecting-box for the Servants&#8217; Home in Tasmania
with a common brass poker; but it had to be done, and
he did it.</p>

<p>He lost his money by gambling, which shows how
wrong and foolish gambling is, and the other man won
it, which proves&mdash;&mdash; What beautiful weather it was on
Bank Holiday, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Still, it was a curious piece of luck.</p>

<p>A man once took out his purse in Fleet Street to buy
a newspaper, and out rolled a golden sovereign. He did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
not see that he had dropped it. He only discovered his
loss that night, and then he remembered the exact spot
where he had taken out his purse. Next day he was ill
in bed; but on the day after he said he should walk back
to Fleet Street and look for that sovereign. His friends
laughed at him. They pointed out that in so crowded a
thoroughfare the coin must have been snapped up in a
moment. But the man was obstinate, and went back.
He did not find the whole coin, but he found twelve
shillings and sixpence of it, and an I.O.U. for the remainder.</p>

<p>Yes, that story&#8217;s a lie. Stories about luck generally are.</p>

<p>That wretched, silly little fly has just perched itself on
my boat&#8217;s nose again. Well, I shall hit it next time&mdash;the
third time.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed how luck is connected with the
number three&mdash;one of the religious numbers? The dream
which comes true is always dreamed three times. At the
cocoanuts, too, you can have three shies for a penny.
There&#8217;s a mystery about these things.</p>

<p>There once was an adopted father, and the son who had
adopted him died without leaving a will, and the poor
father was sonless and penniless. He felt sure that his
adoptive son would never have been thoughtless enough
to omit so important an arrangement as the making of
a will. However, no will was found, and the property of
the rich son was put up to auction. The poor father
watched the sale with a gloomy face. There was the
Broadwood grand-piano, on which his son had taught him
his scales: he saw it disposed of to a stranger, and turned
away to weep. Then a copper coal-scuttle was put up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
auction, and the poor father fancied he heard a voice
within him saying, &#8220;Buy the coal-scuttle! Buy the coal-scuttle!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had but a few pounds left, and it was a Louis XIV.
coal-scuttle; but he bid for it, and ultimately secured it.
With trembling hands he bore it off to the little cottage,
which now was all that he had to call a home. Eagerly
he opened the lid, and saw inside some small coal and
a pair of broken braces.</p>

<p>That shows luck just as much as the other stories; but
luck is like the moon&mdash;we see only one side of it. At any
rate, it is quite as true as the other two stories.</p>

<p>That fly again! This is the third time. I feel that it is
fated. I raise my paddle on high, and bring it down with
one mighty whack and a murmured &#8220;Bismillah!&#8221;</p>

<p>I have missed the fly, and split the paddle, and could do
with <i>something shorter</i> than &#8220;Bismillah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m going home.</p>

ON SOLITUDE: WITH A THIRD ANECDOTE FROM THE<br />
&#8220;ENTERTAINMENTS&#8221; OF KAPNIDES.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF I have gone some distance to seek solitude, it is not
because I am sulky. But I never feel quite certain
at this time of the year that there may not be penny
steamers plying between Silver Street Bridge and Chesterton,
or a Lockhart&#8217;s tea and cocoa palace erected in King&#8217;s.
And I should hardly like to see it. Of course I did not
find absolute solitude even here. The other day an apple
fell on my head while I was like a child picking up pebbles
on the shores of the ocean of life. I saw that there was
no help for it; so I just followed precedent and discovered
a natural law&mdash;that I never get anything I want. I am
quite contented, consequently, that I did not find any
solitude at first, and am pleasantly surprised that a large
picnic party, who came and sniffed all round me suspiciously,
as if they wondered why I was not muzzled, have finally
decided to defile some other part of the river scenery with
their happy laughter and packets of lukewarm comestibles.</p>

<p>I like a crowd immensely. Ditton Corner is good for the
soul. So is the Strand at noon or midnight. But every
one who really likes a crowd, really likes solitude.</p>

<p>It is pleasant enough to lie here in the hot sun, to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
a pipe that does its work properly, and to wonder what
the time is, but not to be enough distressed about it to
take the trouble to consult one&#8217;s watch. I am finishing
the &#8220;Entertainments&#8221; of Kapnides now, and I am not quite
clear about the last story but one in his book. I give it,
in case you have not read it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a most beautiful cloud. Two highly respectable
Athenians looked at it for a long time, and they understood
beauty in Athens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if any one were to paint that,&#8221; said the first,
&#8220;every one would say that it was not natural.&#8221; He felt
there was depth in the remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure of that,&#8221; said the second, intending
to be thought judicious but not disagreeable.</p>

<p>If the cloud had been painted, its chiefest beauty would
have been omitted. For in the centre of the cloud sat
the unborn soul of a girl-child. To all mortals it had no
visible appearance. But the stars, as they crept slowly
up for a night&#8217;s work, saw with smiling eyes a graceful
figure seated in the vapour, leaning a little backward,
white against the crimson pillows of mist, with slender
hands clasped behind a shapely head, and long dark hair
and closed eyes. For it lived, but did not think, after
the manner of unborn souls, which have ways distinctly
of their own.</p>

<p>And as the sun poised over the cool, lighted sea that
sang to welcome it, a noise of little tinkling silver bells was
heard all down the sky; and there was some hurry and
confusion amid Powers which were usually calm with the
unjust, irritating, excessive calmness of a natural law.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>When it was all over, no one exactly knew whose fault
it was. But the Manager was summoned before the great
Zeus, and reprimanded severely. &#8220;It&#8217;s carelessness,&#8221; said
Zeus, &#8220;and that&#8217;s what I can&#8217;t stand. You ought to have
been ready, and there are no two ways about it. You sit
there in the office, wondering how long it will be before
you can sneak out to your beastly lunch, and you forget
that you&#8217;re paid to be managing my business for me all
that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether it was the Manager&#8217;s fault or not, the fact
remained. Down in the world, in the beautiful country
just outside Athens, a boy-child had been born, and he had
been born with the soul of a girl-child inside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a piece of bungling!&#8221; grumbled Zeus, and went
off to play at making orphans.</p>

<p>To play this game you have to be a god, and possess
thunderbolts; every time you kill a father or mother you
score one; if you miss, it counts nothing; if you kill anything
else by mistake, you lose one.</p>

<p>Before the boy was grown Zeus had forgotten all about
it. Perhaps this was as well for the boy, for Zeus had
intended only to give him five years&#8217; life; and perhaps it
was not as well.</p>

<p>At the age of twelve he was tall and straight. But his
face was too delicate, and his eyes were the eyes that had
slumbered a dreamless slumber under the closed lids of the
unborn soul of a girl. And about his ways there was some
sweet shyness and tenderness, or softness&mdash;names do not
matter&mdash;although in courage and spirit and endurance
he had no equal among his comrades. And with all his
comrades he was gentle, and they loved him; but he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
having no care for them nor for the parents who bore him,
and angry with himself because he could feel no such care,
went long, wandering walks alone, and heard strange
stories told him by flowers and birds and winds.</p>

<p>And the years passed, and there was no change until the
boy was sixteen, and then no one knew why he was so
unhappy and quiet; he himself hardly knew. But now his
wanderings would take him away for days at a time. A
spirit of longing possessed him, for which he had no name,
and the fulfilment of it was as a dim, dancing light before
him, baffling and dazzling him, and leaving him no peace.
And of this neither winds, nor birds, nor flowers told him
anything. And the longing drove him to climb where no
others had dared to climb, or to swim far out into the cool
waters of the bay, that he might come back tired and sleep
through the warm fragrant night in the long grass. And
ever in sleep there came one dream and told him all;
and ever when he awoke, the dream was gone from his
memory. So he never knew, but always knew that he had
known.</p>

<p>Comely maidens, with an intimate knowledge of their
own best points, met him sometimes in his wanderings.
And for them he cared nothing at all, and wondered why
one or two of their number looked shyly at him as he
passed them. They said nothing, for maidens are secretive
animals; but one with shapely arms took to herself a new
bracelet; and one with pretty pearly teeth got up a new sigh
which just parted the lips without being ungraceful, and
sounded extremely interesting. However, they might have
painted themselves blue, and have had no effect whatever
on the sorrowful youth. But they were not thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
minded; and, seeing that this sad youth neither loved nor
hated them, they looked out for those who understood love
and hatred, and were married.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s father thought it necessary to consult a
physician about this strange melancholy. Besides, the
youth was growing paler every day, and was listless, and
cared for nothing but to lie asleep, or almost asleep, with
the feathery grass rustling in a gentle whisper over him.</p>

<p>So the physician came, and asked several impertinent
questions. Then he delivered himself upon this wise:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well known that much exercise and weariness
consume the spirits and substance, refrigerate the body;
and such humours which nature would have otherwise
concocted and expelled, it stirs up and makes them rage;
which, being so enraged, diversely affect and trouble the
body and mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are comforting words,&#8221; said the boy&#8217;s father,
who couldn&#8217;t understand them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it vague,&#8221; murmured the boy softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is to the immoderate use of gymnastics,&#8221; said the
physician, &#8220;that I ascribe your son&#8217;s melancholy. Wherefore,
let him drink of a syrup of black hellebore, confected
with the boiled seeds of anise, endive, mallow, fermitory,
diacatholicon, hierologodium&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Half-time&mdash;&mdash;change ends,&#8221; said the boy under his
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cassia and sweet almonds,&#8221; continued the physician.
&#8220;And in the meantime he may drink of a broth of an
exenterated chicken.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had heard the youth&#8217;s last remark. &#8220;And,&#8221; he added
severely, &#8220;let him beware of intempestive laughter.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>So the physician went away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; asked the mother of the youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the father, &#8220;he said that the boy had been
growing too fast, at least he implied that, and he prescribed
hierolo&mdash;&mdash;French for chicken broth, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>But while the doctor&#8217;s prescription was being prepared,
the boy went off to the cliffs; and he stretched himself at
full length on the thyme, and went to sleep, and dreamed
the old sweet dream, and the sun drew near to its setting,
and in his pleasant sleep the boy died.</p>

<p>Never had there been a happier and more desirable
death.</p>

<p>And under the burning sun a cloud was stretched like a
cloth of gold.</p>

<p>And the two highly respectable Athenians came out to
look at it. &#8220;If I were to paint that exactly as it is,&#8221; said the
first, &#8220;every one would say that my picture was intensely
unnatural.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Zeus!&#8221; ejaculated the second, for the first had
made the remark nearly every night for rather more than
sixteen years, and still thought there was a certain insight
about it.</p>

<p>In the golden heart of the cloud were together the soul
of a youth and the soul of a young girl, two souls that had
done their work and were resting. He sat in careless
happiness looking down at her: for she was stretched at his
feet, making a daisy-chain with the souls of the daisies that
were to bloom next year. And ever she would look up from
her work into his eyes; and the eyes of the two were strangely
alike, and soft and bright.</p>

<p>Into the cloud came the Manager. He was in a terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
hurry; for there had been great doings in Sicily, and an
army had been cut to pieces, and consequently there was a
press of business.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve called to take your numbers,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>They both gave the same number.</p>

<p>He seemed a little startled, then recovered himself, and
jotted it down in his note-book. &#8220;I remember now,&#8221; he
said, half apologetically. &#8220;It was not entirely my fault.
I had slipped out to get a glass of beer, and I told the boy
to send for me if anything happened. But he thought he
could manage it himself, and he blundered, and I was
blamed. So you both were born in the same body. I
hope you were not crowded. Zeus had intended you to be
born in different bodies, and fall in love with one another
down below. But you can do it up here, you know. It&#8217;s
not the same thing, but some people think it&#8217;s better: it&#8217;s
much more spiritual. You will have this cloud all to yourselves
for as long as you like. At any rate it was not so
hard on you as it was on the girl&#8217;s body, which had to be
born without any soul at all&mdash;but I am told that she
made money out of it. Well, I must be off; good evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Manager departed, and they were alone, and they
floated away into the night when the night came. And the
sea sang beneath them, and the wind was warm and perfumed
with flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you for ever and ever,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The same remark had just occurred to her&mdash;not
strikingly original, perhaps, but both were satisfied with it.</p>

ON ASSOCIATIONS: TOGETHER WITH A LAST ANECDOTE<br />
FROM THE &#8220;ENTERTAINMENTS&#8221; OF KAPNIDES.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;THINK <i>Zeitgeist</i> has grown lazy; I had meant to take
it a long way to-day, but it simply stopped at the first
shady spot it could find, and stretched itself there. One
has to smoke a little brown tobacco to keep off the midges,
but otherwise I do not mind much. I would not make
use of my superior strength to force a tired boat to do more
than it wanted to do. Besides, <i>Zeitgeist</i> has earned some
consideration. It has behaved excellently; in fact, it has
almost been morbid in the politeness with which it has
avoided running into other boats lately. Somebody, I see,
has put a bottle of cider into the canoe. How thoughtless
of him! There are a corkscrew and a drinking-horn as
well. Perhaps it&#8217;s all for the best.</p>

<p>The taste of cider should be full of associations. It
should recall orchards in Devonshire; and rustic inns with
porches, and honeysuckle, and earwigs; and the simple
village maiden who got to be rather fond of the stranger
artist, and cried a little in her simple village way when he
went back again to civilisation. I am starving for dreamy
poetry and pleasant memories this morning; I wish this
cider had such beautiful associations for me. But it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
not. To me cider is cider, and it is nothing more. I have
never been in a Devonshire orchard; and I am not an
artist; I have never drawn anything.</p>

<p>Except corks. By the way, I may as well put that bottle
of cider in the shallow water here. It will cool it. Then,
afterwards, I may be able to forgive the person who put it
into my canoe.</p>

<p>I am not sure that people do not set too much store by
associations. There is an old tune that most people have
forgotten, I dare say; perhaps it is not very good music;
in fact, I would take an affidavit that it is the nastiest,
tuniest tune I ever heard, and yet it has associations for
me. It recalls to me my landlady&#8217;s daughter; it was the
tune she loved most and played most frequently; she was
rather an ugly girl, too. But I do not value the tune any
more on that account; I believe it makes me hate it more
bitterly.</p>

<p>I should think that cider must be almost cool by now,
but I will give it another minute or two.</p>

<p>I suppose it is for the sake of associations that people
have their dead pets stuffed, or have portions of them made
into tobacco-pouches or paper-knives. I never had any pet
myself except one solitary, evil dog; he was an original dog,
and was perfectly good-tempered with everybody except his
master. I am thankful to say that I possess absolutely nothing
which reminds me of him. The smell of tar has curious
associations for me. It reminds me of a day when I drove
frantically in the direction of Liverpool Street, with the
intention of catching the 10.30. I had offered my cabby
vast sums to get me there in time, and he certainly did his
best. I did not stop to take a ticket, but dashed across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the platform, and entered the train just as it was moving
out. I sank back on the cushions with a sigh of relief.
One gets so much pleasure out of <i>just</i> doing a thing.
Then I found out that the train which I had entered was
not the 10.30, was not going to the same place, and was
not thinking of stopping anywhere for some considerable
time. Perhaps you wonder why the smell of tar should
remind me of this. So do I. I have not the least notion
why it is.</p>

<p>One must not expect to see the reason for the connection
always. Why are the girls with the biggest feet always
devoted to quite inferior works of fiction? Why are clean-shaven
men always cynical?</p>

<p>Then of course there are the tender, romantic associations.
A good deal might be said about them. In the meantime
I can&#8217;t think where I&#8217;ve put that corkscrew. Ah! here it
is, sitting under one of the cushions and laughing at me.
Now for the cider, with a golden glow in it like the curls of
the love-god himself.</p>

<p>And flat&mdash;miserably flat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I said, <i>Zeitgeist</i> does not care to move about much.
So I have amused myself with reading the last anecdote in
the &#8220;Entertainments&#8221; of Kapnides. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A general feeling of content prevailed in the house of
Zeus &amp; Co. &#8220;We shall declare,&#8221; said Zeus, &#8220;such a
dividend as never was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall,&#8221; said Co.</p>

<p>Zeus &amp; Co. occupied the two thrones at the back of
the large hall. During the last spring-cleaning, Zeus had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
ordered his own throne to be regilded. Nothing had been
done to the other throne, which was occupied by Co. But
Co. was quite humble. As a general rule he merely echoed
the sentiments of Zeus. If he felt the difference between the
two thrones, he had never mentioned it. Perhaps it might
be as well to notice that all the shares were in the hands
of Zeus &amp; Co. They were the directors, and also the
shareholders. By this arrangement much unpleasantness
was avoided.</p>

<p>But at this moment an old gentleman in a very shiny coat
rose from the desk at the farther end of the hall, and
stepped towards the thrones. He looked at Zeus, coughed
a little nervously, and began:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Zeus, and also Mr. Co., you will excuse me, but I&#8217;ve
a little matter to bring before you, in my position as Chief
Agent in the Punishment Department.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; said Zeus kindly. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing
wrong, I hope. It&#8217;s a good department.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very good and profitable department,&#8221; echoed Co.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Zeus, you will probably remember that you
assigned to me a young subordinate, a mere boy, called Eros.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; said Zeus. &#8220;He was not to draw any
regular salary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely so,&#8221; replied the Agent. &#8220;He just took his
small commission on every broken heart. Well, up to the
present I&#8217;ve had no complaint to make of him. He did his
work well and cheerfully. The Suicide Section used to send
me in most favourable reports of him. I had even intended
to recommend him for promotion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But without increase of salary, I hope,&#8221; said Zeus.
&#8220;The shareholders would never stand that, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;They simply wouldn&#8217;t tolerate it for a minute,&#8221; echoed
Co. It was not supposed to be generally known that
Zeus &amp; Co. were the only shareholders.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; answered the Agent. &#8220;I should have left
the question of salary to you. I hope I know my place,
sir. But, if you will believe it, that boy actually wants
to resign the post he holds already. He got mixed up in
that Psyche business a good deal, you know. I never knew
the rights of the case exactly; but I do know that he&#8217;s not
been the same boy since, and takes no pleasure in his work
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, show him in,&#8221; said Zeus irritably, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll have
a word or two to say to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; suggested Co., &#8220;if the Agent can have been
fool enough to let the boy know that he was a punishment
and not a blessing?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the Agent, who had retired, reappeared
with Eros. He was a handsome boy, but it was evident
that he was very angry. His eyes flashed, and tears stood
in them. He made no obeisance to Zeus, but with a
rapid movement unslung his bow and quiver from his
shoulders, and snapt bow and arrows, one after another,
across his knee, flinging them down on the floor of the
hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of that,&#8221; he said shortly, setting his
lips tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you aware,&#8221; said Co. solemnly, &#8220;that what you
have just broken is the property of the shareholders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And are you aware,&#8221; thundered Zeus, &#8220;what the
dickens you&#8217;re talking about? Explain yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy burst into tears. &#8220;I <i>won&#8217;t</i> do it any more,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
he sobbed. &#8220;I <i>won&#8217;t</i>. I&#8217;m not a blessing; I&#8217;m a curse.
And I&#8217;m not going to be your servant, because you hate
everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Co. quietly; &#8220;we love them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what does your first rule mean?&#8221; asked the boy
fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first rule,&#8221; replied Co., &#8220;is that twenty years shall
not be enough to make a life, and ten minutes shall be
more than enough to spoil it. We made that rule to stop
people spoiling their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeus rubbed his hands softly together, and smiled, and
said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mind once,&#8221; the boy went on, &#8220;when I made
women weep and men rave. I do now. It&#8217;s always the
same thing. They long, and long, and cannot obtain; and
then the weaker sort kill themselves, and the stronger sort
grow cruel. Or, if they obtain, misery in one form or
another follows. I resign my post.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just pass me that thunderbolt,&#8221; said Zeus, in an unpleasant
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can kill me,&#8221; the boy exclaimed, contemptuously,
&#8220;I care nothing for that. I wish I had never
lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you mistake,&#8221; said Co., suavely, &#8220;you mistake;
Mr. Zeus had no intention of killing you. You have a
right to resign your post if you like. He was going to kill
a young girl named Psyche.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; gasped Eros.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence. Then Eros spoke in
a hard, unnatural voice. &#8220;I will go back to my work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Zeus, and do it better than ever, if you will not kill
Psyche.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Zeus kindly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be
disagreeable; as long as I kill somebody, it doesn&#8217;t matter.
Now, trot along to your work, my boy, and I won&#8217;t kill
Psyche.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the boy went back to his work, and did it better than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a good idea of yours, Co.,&#8221; said Zeus, after
a moment&#8217;s pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much may be done by kindness,&#8221; replied Co.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think this throne of mine looks a little shabby
beside yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give the order to have it regilded,&#8221; said Zeus
affably.</p>

<p>But, if things go on like this, it will be &#8220;Co. &amp; Zeus&#8221;
soon.</p>
</div>

<p>It&#8217;s getting late; time for me to take <i>Zeitgeist</i> home again.</p>

<p>A curate was once complaining to me about certain hardships
that he suffered at the hands of his vicar. &#8220;And,
above all,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am never allowed to preach an
evening sermon. I get no chances. The vicar always
preaches the evening sermons.&#8221; There was a good deal
of justice in the complaint; we are all naturally more
righteous in the evening. When the light dies behind
the stained windows, and the music speaks, and through
the open doors you can smell the syringa-bushes, then&mdash;for
some reason that I know not&mdash;it is more easy to think
oneself a sinner and to wish one were not. Preaching
would naturally be more effective at such a time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>It is evening now, and I have been thinking about the
different things that I am going to eat shortly. I do not
know what is wrong with me that I should be so low. But
external circumstances that suggest one line of thought are
always liable to suggest the exact opposite. It has been
proved by statistics that two-thirds of the best English
jokes are invented, but not necessarily spoken, at funerals.
Perhaps this accounts for the depression one always has to
conceal when one hears of the joy or success of a dear
friend.</p>

<p><i>Zeitgeist</i> will have a long rest now&mdash;until my return. I
could wish for some reasons that I had a more complete
control over that boat; that, when I started out with it, I
could be more definitely sure where it was going; that, in
short, its nature was less petulant. However, there is a
charm in uncertainty. I forgive it everything.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">I.<br />


CLIO&#8217;S STORY: CHARLES MARIUS.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON a beautiful summer night of last long vacation a
cloud sailed slowly out of the west. The sun was
going down; the honest worker had fallen asleep over his
books, and in his dream was standing before a booking
office in the Bay of Tarentum and asking for a second aorist
return to Clapham; the jubilant whist player, holding the
situation in his hand, had exhausted the trumps, and was
bringing in the rest of a long suit; the mere conversationalist
had worked in that epigram again, and the mere athlete,
who did not believe in that fancy kind of talk, had gone
away to drink a little good beer; the fiery bedmaker had
just gone round to the kitchens, to tell the men precisely
what she thought about them: in fact, everything&mdash;except
the cloud&mdash;was much as usual. But the cloud was extraordinary.</p>

<p>It was granted to me to see that cloud close at hand,
to stand in its midst, to hear what was spoken there,
while I remained unseen and unheard. I do not wish
to speak of myself much, because it seems to me vain
and immodest; but I must say that I believe the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
reason why I was permitted to behold the Muses, and
to hear the stories which they told to one another to
while away the summer night, is that my nature is
singularly pure, and good, and spiritual, and free from
grossness, and beautiful. So, I feel sure, is your nature,
my dear reader, although in a less degree.</p>

<p>In the front of the cloud hung a rosy curtain of some
delicate tissue, and behind this curtain was the rose-lit
room in which the Muses were grouped. Clio was
standing erect. She wore a long and ample robe; her
figure was stately; her look was the look of a handsome,
learned woman, who is on the brink of her
thirtieth year. In one hand was an open roll of paper,
on which gilt letters were blazoned. She was looking
down upon the towers, and steeples, and house-tops of Cambridge,
and on the slow river winding like a reluctant
silver corkscrew through the beautiful meadows of Grantchester.</p>

<p>Behind her, seven of her sisters, picturesquely grouped,
reclined on a low divan at the farther end of the room.
They all were beautiful in different ways. Their robes,
snow-white and pearly-grey, golden and crimson and deep-sea
blue, made a poem of colour.</p>

<p>And on the mosaic floor, kneeling on one knee, bending
over a little tripod that supported a brazier, was one
who wore no robe, but the long night of her beautiful hair.
Mockery was on her lips, but dreams were in her eyes.
She seemed a young girl of seventeen. She was Erato,
who sings to us of love. The picture of her in the classical
dictionaries is absurdly wrong. Beside her on the floor lay
her lyre and a curious golden casket. From the brazier a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
thin, wandering line of fragrant smoke came up, and hovered
in the room.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence. Then Clio turned
round to her sisters. &#8220;We will stay here,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;for a little while. This is Granta; and here are gathered
young men who are truly gymnasts and yet follow the
Muses. For they do all of them seek after culture, and
love naught but the reading of many learned books, and the
hearing of the wisdom of their teachers; and they all strive
to lead the higher life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Terpsichore gave a curious little cough. I have no
certain idea what it meant; but it seemed to imply in
some way that she had been there before. The grave
and stately Clio never noticed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we will stay, and tell to one another improving
stories,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Cupid! Cupid!&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>A curtain at the side of the room was flung aside, and
in came a little winged boy, with laughing eyes, naked
but for the quiver that hung from the shoulders. He
does a good deal for the Muses, but not in a menial way.
They all smiled when he came in. He stood by the side
of Erato, who evidently petted him a good deal, drawing
one strand of her dark hair through his little rosy fingers&mdash;but
he was looking at Clio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; said the grave Muse, &#8220;we would stay here: let
the wind blow our cloud no farther.&#8221; He nodded his head,
turned to go, and then lingered, still playing with Erato&#8217;s hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Erato,&#8221; he whispered in her ear, &#8220;my bow-string is
frayed. Let me make a bow-string of your hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;perhaps&mdash;not now. You wicked little boy!&#8221; she
said, looking up in his face and laughing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Then soon,&#8221; he whispered again, and passed once
more behind the curtain. I do not know what he did,
but the wind ceased, and the cloud remained still. Clio
took her place on the divan. &#8220;Who shall begin?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you!&#8221; they all cried together.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the eldest, you know,&#8221; added Erato, a little
maliciously. Erato had taken a cushion from the divan,
and stretched herself very lazily on the floor. I am afraid
the other Muses were all anxious to get Clio&#8217;s story over as
soon as possible. History was her province, and she was
so exceedingly historical as to be sometimes almost dull.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then. I will begin,&#8221; said Clio. &#8220;The
number of temporal lords summoned by writ to the parliaments
of the House of Plantagenet was exceedingly
various.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clio paused. There was a sly, mischievous look on
Erato&#8217;s face; she stretched out one hand to the golden
casket, and took from it a little powder, which she dropped
into the brazier. A strange, pungent odour came up from
it. I do not know what it was, but it had a curious
effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I will begin again,&#8221; said Clio. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
wrong story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she told the story which follows. I am afraid the
powder had a little to do with it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With the battle of Waterloo the last hope of Charles
was humbled in the dust. Three years afterwards he
was found by the lictors seated in a poor third-class
compartment in the railway junction which was erected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
on the site of that scene of carnage, and still retains
the name of Waterloo. Charles surveyed them from the
window, calmly and unflinchingly. &#8220;Go,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
tell the Carthaginians that you have seen Marius seated
in the South-Eastern Express for Charing Cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>His request was never carried out. It was almost
impossible to book through to Carthage, and it was too
far to walk. With tears in their eyes, the lictors
walked sorrowfully away to the refreshment-room. The
train steamed out of the station and arrived a week later
at Charing Cross, a little tired, but in fairly good condition.
Charles Marius levied two benevolences on the arrival
platform, and conferred a monopoly on the bookstall;
but he was not looking at all well. The marshes of
Minturn&aelig;, and a rooted dislike to being called a man of
blood, had preyed on his mind, and made him appear
haggard and anxious. He was met under the clock by
the aged Menenius Agrippa, Socrates, John Bradshaw,
the Spanish Ambassador, and others. John Bradshaw was
naturally the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;As Serjeant-at-Law and President of the High Court of
Justice, it is my painful duty to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay,&#8221; interrupted Menenius Agrippa. &#8220;I once told a
fable to the Plebeians, and it did good. It is not generally
known, and it may be of service in the present critical
juncture. Charles Marius, you man of blood, listen. Once
upon a time the members refused to work any longer for the
Belly, which led a lazy life, and grew fat upon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, my dear friend, don&#8217;t,&#8221; said the Spanish Ambassador
piteously. &#8220;We know it by heart. It&#8217;s all in
little Smith.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;But it may do good,&#8221; said the aged Menenius. &#8220;How
far had I got? Oh yes&mdash;and grew fat upon their toils.
But receiving no longer any nourishment from the Belly,
they soon began to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a cheerful porter, with a merry cry
of &#8220;Now then, stoopid!&#8221; ran a heavy truckful of luggage
into the aged Menenius and bowled him over. This gave
John Bradshaw an opportunity to resume his remarks:</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemeth to me that the time hath now gone by
when the telling of fables might serve the body politick;
and seeing what grave charges have been exhibited against
you, Charles Marius, you man of blood, and duly proven
before me, it behoveth us rather to inquire into the method
which shall be deemed most suitable for your execution.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on to point out that there were many methods
of execution, but that it was most agreeable to the sense of
the nation that Charles Marius should be taken to a very
small, very cheap, very dirty, very Italian restaurant; and
that he should drink there one bottle of that sound dinner-wine
Raisonola at eleven shillings the dozen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hereby give our royal word,&#8221; said Charles Marius;
but he was sternly checked by the Serjeant-at-Law.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need nothing of your royal word, having in former
times had too much of it. I myself will walk first, accompanied
by the Spanish Ambassador and Menenius
Agrippa. You, Socrates, will accompany that man of
blood, Charles Marius, and administer to him the consolations
of your philosophy. You others will remain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sad procession filed out of Charing Cross Station.
Menenius Agrippa looked a little angry, and was brushing
the dust from his toga; but the Spanish Ambassador and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
John Bradshaw were intensely stately and dignified. Behind
them walked Socrates and Charles Marius. Socrates
began at once:</p>

<p>&#8220;Seeing, my friend, that you are about to be executed,
let us speak of execution. For it is well to speak always
of the thing which is the present thing. So, setting aside
your misconduct under H. Metellus Stanleius in Africa,
let us discuss this execution. Now, I have often wondered
why to the many it always seems an evil to be executed.
For if a will be duly executed, it takes force therefrom.
Now, to acquire force is plainly to be reckoned among the
good things. Therefore to be executed must be good and
desirable. Or shall we say rather that words have no
meaning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to the deuce!&#8221; said Charles Marius sulkily. &#8220;We
offered John Bradshaw our royal word, and he refused to
take it. So we won&#8217;t talk at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he never said another word until they were all
five seated at one table in the Italian restaurant. A
melancholy waiter of no nationality brought a soiled bill
of fare; he also added two forks and a mustard-pot as a
kind of after-thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring,&#8221; said John Bradshaw, &#8220;one bottle of Raisonola
and one glass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ver&#8217; well,&#8221; said the waiter sadly, flicking a dead fly
off the table with one end of his napkin. &#8220;It will be a
shilling, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pay afterwards,&#8221; said John Bradshaw sharply.</p>

<p>The waiter shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;I am ver&#8217; sorry,
but we mos&#8217; always ask for ze monny before we bring ze
Raisonola. We haf our orders. You see we haf often had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
a trouble to get ze monny afterwards from ze heirs. Tree
weeks ago two gemmens kom in and order ze Raisonola.
They trink it, and die all over ze floor.&#8221; (An expressive
shrug of shoulders came in again here.) &#8220;We sweep &#8217;em
up, and throw &#8217;em away, and they pay us nossin&mdash;nossin
at all. It is all so moch loss.&#8221; His hands were turned
outward, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, my man,&#8221; said Menenius Agrippa quickly.
&#8220;Once upon a time the members refused to work any
longer for the Belly, which&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dry up,&#8221; thundered John Bradshaw. &#8220;We must pay,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;And it so befalleth that I have not my purse,
but the Spanish Ambassador&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ambassador explained that he had only Spanish
coins with him, which would not be accepted. Socrates
hastily added the information that he always took his
money straight home to Xantippe, and that if he was
short that night there would be unpleasantness.</p>

<p>Menenius said that he had no money, but would be glad
to continue his fable. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see. Where was I? Oh, I
know&mdash;any longer for the Belly, which&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do drop it,&#8221; sighed the Spanish Ambassador pathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; said John Bradshaw. &#8220;Charles, be a man,
and pay for your own execution.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles offered his note-of-hand and his royal word.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">He nothing common did or mean</div>
<div class="verse">Upon that memorable scene.</div>
</div></div>

<p>But the waiter refused them. And the five were compelled
to leave the restaurant. There was a crowd round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
door. When they had got clear of the crowd, one of
their number was missing. It was Charles Marius.</p>

<p>The rest of the story is well known. Charles Marius
escaped to St. Helena, and spent the rest of his life in
collaborating with Dr. Gauden on a novel called &#8220;Eikon
Basilike.&#8221; The failure of the execution preyed upon John
Bradshaw&#8217;s mind, and in a fit of madness he wrote the
time-tables which bear his name. Menenius Agrippa became
a diner-out, and acquired the surname of &#8220;History,&#8221;
because he always repeated himself. The Ambassador
still lives in his castle in Spain.</p>

<p>Clio had finished. &#8220;Thank you so much,&#8221; said the

EUTERPE&#8217;S STORY: THE GIRL AND THE MINSTREL.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was silence for a few moments. Erato,
stretched lazily on the floor, looking up at the
dim-lit roof of the cloud-chamber, let her pretty lips curve
half-way to a smile, when she checked herself suddenly;
she never could keep her thoughts still for a moment,&mdash;they
flew from poor Clio&#8217;s story to a story of her own. She
was thinking now of a hot summer night in Sicily, and of
one who walked across the low hills, with flocks pattering
softly after him, and seen but indistinctly in those fragrant
moments when the evening touches the darkness. She
thought of him. As he went, he piped a melody&mdash;a simple
strain enough, but with one of those quaint refrains that
nestle down in the memory of a man. Ah&mdash;and afterwards!</p>

<p>&#8220;Clio,&#8221; she said, drawing a long breath, &#8220;I have a
story, sweet and fit for a summer night, a story of the
joyousness, and rapture, and sorrow of Love. Will you
hear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, Clio!&#8221; said Terpsichore. &#8220;Erato once told
me a story, and it was so lovely and dreamy. It had the
temper of soft valse music. One&#8217;s heart throbbed to it:
one lived to it, as it were. Let us hear Erato&#8217;s story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not just yet, I think,&#8221; answered Clio. &#8220;We must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
not forget that Granta lies beneath us. Far down below
our feet, one sits&mdash;a young man with red hair&mdash;amid
many dictionaries. He is turning into Latin elegiacs
those beautiful lines&mdash;I quote from memory&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">His head was bare, his matted hair</div>
<div class="indent">Was shaved to keep him cool.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Already he has seven feet in his hexameter, and knows it
not, because the gods do not like him. If we let thoughts
of love stray forth from our cloud-chamber, and flutter down
into that young man&#8217;s red head, I fear that he would never
get the pentameter at all. No, Erato, to these young men
love is a disturbing influence; they avoid the maidens, and
care only for a surer knowledge of Greek accentuation.
When they have all gone to bed, you shall tell your story;
great personages in history have fallen in love; I myself
have no prejudice against it. But you may choose which
of us shall tell the next story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erato sighed, and glanced round the room. When her
eyes fell on Euterpe her face brightened. And truly Euterpe
was good to see: she had a wonderful grace of body, and
fresh gladness in her eyes; yet there was a depth in the
look of her; it was the look of one not easily understood,
of one who could feel a sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I choose Euterpe, because she is so beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little flush came into Euterpe&#8217;s cheeks; her lips
parted, showing her small white teeth. She was ever
shy and quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would sooner sing to you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am more
used to singing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear, it must be a story,&#8221; said Clio firmly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;And perhaps a song will come into it,&#8221; added Erato
sweetly.</p>

<p>Then Euterpe told this story. And all the time that
she was telling it Erato sat gazing upward into Euterpe&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The child came through the forest. The big trees grew
close together, and creeping plants hung like heavy serpents
from their boughs. The sun found its way through, here
and there, among the broad, smooth leaves, and made
splashes of light on the red gold of the child&#8217;s hair. One
bird called to another; every now and then there was a
flutter among the leaves, or the quick rustle of some small
live thing in the tall grasses and brushwood below, and a
scented wind kept singing of a land of rest where the good
winds go when they die. From far away one could hear
the low roar of a lion, as he stood by the margin of the
distant morass, looking over stretches of sand and spaces of
still water to the line of grey hills that seemed to be the
end of the world.</p>

<p>The child was very fair. Her hair was glorious; her
eyes were blue; her young limbs were white, and strong,
and graceful. Yet one might see a fierce look in the blue
eyes, and splashes of crimson here and there on the white
limbs, and her breath came quickly; for it was in her nature
to torture and to kill, and she knew no better thing. In
one hand she dragged along the body of a young wild cat,
scarcely more than a kitten. She lived ever in the open
air, and she was fleet and fearless. All the morning she
had chased it, until it was weary; yet, although it was
young, it had fought long and fiercely. On the hand that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
dragged it along were the marks of its claws and teeth;
thick drops of blood fell slowly on to its body, and its fur
was wet and stained. The child wore a living, tortured,
fluttering necklace. She had caught the butterflies one by
one, choosing those which were brightest in colour, and had
threaded a spiked tendril through the soft bodies to make
herself the necklace. She liked the tickling fuss and flutter
that the butterflies made against her smooth skin, as they
hung there and died slowly.</p>

<p>A great purple flower, that grew low down on the ground,
lifted its brightness towards her as she passed: &#8220;And, oh!&#8221;
sighed the flower, &#8220;she is fair, and sweet would it be if
she would take me and wear me gently at her breast.&#8221; The
child did not know the voice of flowers; but she stooped
down and tore off the purple petals one by one. From the
cup of the flower rolled a big golden bee: he had been
sleeping there. For one second he buzzed on the ground,
trying to remember where he was and to understand what
had happened. In that second the child had swiftly seized
a stone, and so she crushed most of the bee, leaving it
enough life to let it feel the agony of death. She flung
down the body of the wild cat, and ran on for a few steps,
with a laugh on her red mouth. Then she stopped again
where a nest was built in a bush with very dark leaves and
little white globes of flowers. In the nest were three young
birds: two of these she cast to the ground and killed at
once: she held the third in her small hot hands for a
second, and a kind of frenzy came on her, and she made
her firm teeth meet in its neck. For a little while she
stood shuddering, and then she passed onwards, but more
slowly. Slowly she came through the forest in her fairness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and cruelty, caring nothing for her own beauty, and knowing
nothing better than her cruelty.</p>

<p>And it chanced that she came to the place where the
minstrel sat in pleasant shade on a mossy curve of a
tree&#8217;s root. In his hands was his lyre, and music came
from it like falling water. The child crept into the
brushwood, and hid herself, and listened. And the
minstrel sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Far away is the land where all things go,</div>
<div class="verse">The rest of the winds that have ceased to blow,</div>
<div class="verse">The peace of the rose whose leaves lie low,</div>
<div class="verse">Scattered and dead, where roses grow.</div>
<div class="indent11">Far away! far away!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There the dead bird takes a song again,</div>
<div class="verse">And the steed has rest from the spur and rein,</div>
<div class="verse">And the dead man learns that all were vain&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">All the old struggles, and joys, and pain.</div>
<div class="indent11">Far away! far away!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And the light on their eyes is a wondrous light,</div>
<div class="verse">Where there is not day and there is not night,</div>
<div class="verse">Where the fallen star once more grows bright</div>
<div class="verse">That fell into darkness out of the height&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent11">Far away! far away!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Let me win there ere the break of day,</div>
<div class="verse">Ere the first faint light o&#8217;er the hills grows grey,</div>
<div class="verse">I am tired of my work and tired of my play,</div>
<div class="verse">And I&#8217;ll make better songs in the land far away,&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent11">Far away! far away!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The voice ceased; but the music of the lyre still flowed
on, and the minstrel looked upwards towards the sky. No
word of cruelty had been in the song; but through the
music her first knowledge of gentleness came to the child,
and she saw that she had been cruel. She crouched there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
amid the tall rank grasses; her face had grown whiter and
whiter; her eyes were strained and piteous, but there was
no tear in them. With trembling fingers she unfastened
the living fluttering necklace, and gently killed all the
butterflies to spare them torture. Then she flung herself
prone on the ground, with her forehead on her linked hands;
her red lips quivered a little, but the relief of tears came
not. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; she moaned, &#8220;why was I so cruel? Why did
I never know?&#8221; The wind played with her hair, moving it
caressingly.</p>

<p>As the child lay there, and the minstrel played on and on,
the sky above grew darker. There was no need now for
pleasant shade. Over the line of grey hills that seemed to
be the end of the world rested the storm-clouds, black and
purple. Suddenly the air became quite still, as if it were
waiting for something. Was it the roar of the lion or the
voice of the storm that sounded dimly afar off?</p>

<p>Once more the minstrel raised his voice to song, and
anger was in his eyes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The pure white flower grew up in the way</div>
<div class="verse">Where the wild cat&#8217;s whelp went forth to play.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And the whelp rent the flower for the gold within,</div>
<div class="verse">And a child slew the whelp for its soft warm skin.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And the lion slew the child for a draught of blood,</div>
<div class="verse">And the river swept the lion away in its flood.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And the gods dried the river in its deep stone bed,</div>
<div class="verse">And all from the flower to the stream were dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We are things that the gods make sport upon:</div>
<div class="verse">We shall have no peace till the gods are gone.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The child had raised herself to watch the minstrel. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
he sang the last words the skies seemed to snap overhead;
a quick flash shot downwards, like the thrust of ghostly
steel. For a moment the child&#8217;s eyes were dazzled; then
the loud roar of thunder seemed to fill the forest and the
sky. When she looked again she saw that the minstrel had
fallen forward on his face; by his side was his lyre, with the
strings broken and smouldering; from his body, charred
by the lightning, delicate strays of smoke curled up. The
child came, and knelt by the side of the dead minstrel.
She raised his head, and looked piteously upon it, for the
beauty had all gone out of it now; then she pressed her
little red lips to the blackened lips of the dead man, and
went on her way. It was the first kiss she had ever given.</p>

<p>And still she did not weep; but the blood in her veins
seemed to be as fire, and strange voices were sounding in
her head. When the evening fell she stood by the edge
of the swamp. Out of a dim cavern crept an old lion, and
looked at her with green, hungry eyes. His lips curled a
little backward. The child called to him: &#8220;Come, then!
I have been seeking for you! Torture me, and then let me
die!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lion turned swiftly round, and fled with a howl back
into the cavern.</p>

<p>The child wandered on. She ate the black poison
berries, but they would not hurt her. At last, when the
moon was up, she saw a dark, deep pool, and flung herself
into it; but the pool cast her back again on to the shore.
She was fain to die, and to atone; but the gods knew their
business better than to allow it.</p>

<p>And still she walks through the forest, seeking rest and
finding it not, and she speaks to none. Only sometimes at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
night, when the golden moon comes up behind the low
grey hills, she sings in a sweet child&#8217;s voice a few lines of
a remembered song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Let me win there ere the break of day,</div>
<div class="verse">Ere the first faint light o&#8217;er the hills grows grey!</div>
<div class="verse">I am tired of my work and tired of my play,</div>
<div class="verse">And I&#8217;ll make better songs in the land far away,&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent11">Far away! far away!</div>
</div></div>

<p>And the gods are immensely amused.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Thalia, &#8220;though I don&#8217;t care much for
those fanciful high-toned stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Erato rose, and seated herself on the divan by
Euterpe&#8217;s side, and wound one arm round her waist, and
kissed her on the lips. I thought they looked rather pretty
and poetical; but I don&#8217;t go in much for that kind of thing
myself.</p>

TERPSICHORE&#8217;S STORY: THE UNDER-STUDY.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A SHORT pause, and then Erato spoke, addressing
Clio:</p>

<p>&#8220;Clio, my dear, and reverend sister, do you think these
young men below us, in the colleges, have gone to bed
yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; said Clio, &#8220;you could hardly expect
me to&mdash;&mdash;well, as far as I can judge, some of them are still
up and at work. The young red-headed man is stamping
up and down his room, as if he were angry. He has
discovered that his hexameter would not do, for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">His head was bare, his matted hair,</div>
</div></div>

<p>and he has been trying it a different way. Now he moans:
&#8216;&#8220;Caput erat nudum&#8221;&mdash;and the &#8220;a&#8221; &#8217;s short, and I wish I
was dead!&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked the question,&#8221; said Erato, &#8220;because a story
has just occurred to me, which I should like to tell you.
I read it in the French. I don&#8217;t think it would hurt the
young men, even if they could hear it. I&#8217;ll tone it down
a little, of course. There&#8217;s one splendid part where the
husband&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Thalia drily. &#8220;In those pretty French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
stories there generally is one splendid part where the
husband&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and she also paused suddenly. She looked
at Erato, and they both smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not! Most certainly not!&#8221; said Clio at
once. &#8220;You must remember, Erato, that this is not the
Greek civilisation. The English have got beyond that:
they have advanced; they sweep through the deep while
the stormy winds do blow, and hearts of oak are their
men, and they&#8217;d take a cup o&#8217; kindness yet on the place
where the old hoss died. I make these last remarks on
the authority of their own favourite songs, of which I have
made a special study for my book on National Misfortunes.
I assure you, Erato, that any University paper which printed
your story would be ruined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well!&#8221; answered Erato. &#8220;I have heard it said that
Love&#8217;s a lost art nowadays.&#8221; She paused a second, and
then added: &#8220;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps they are happier without it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said Terpsichore. &#8220;Everything depends
on the way you take it. Some take their love laughing,
and some take it crying. I always take it laughing
myself. Either way, you&#8217;re happier for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Terpsichore,&#8221; murmured Clio reprovingly.</p>

<p>Terpsichore did not heed her. &#8220;Where they are so
wrong nowadays is in taking their love commercially; in
other words, they do not <i>love</i>; they simply acquire all rights
in a cheap housekeeper or an expensive table ornament.
They are so much too judicious. Yet sometimes&mdash;well,
there was a man&mdash;shall I go on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do,&#8221; said Erato.</p>

<p>And this is the way that Terpsichore went on:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />





<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>There was a man once&mdash;not very long ago&mdash;who was poor,
but artistic; and during his life he had rather more than his
share of coincidences. It happened one autumn that he
was amusing himself by wandering about a country that
was good enough for an artist, but failed to attract many
tourists because it did not boast enough places where you
had to pay for admission. He had stayed a few days in a
little village, where there was one street that went tumbling
downhill, sometimes with cottages on each side, sometimes
through clumps of stunted trees, sometimes with the open
heath all round it. It happened one night that he was
wandering down this street, and had reached one of those
places where the street turned into a country lane for a time,
or rather for a space. He was smoking, and humming to
himself a song that he had heard Viola sing a few months
before.</p>

<p>Viola had taken very fair hold of the town that season.
It was not only that she sang divinely; she was beautiful,
and a little mysterious. The numerous stories told about
her were rendered probable by her beauty, which was rather
wicked; but no one could be certain about them because
she was so mysterious. Besides, many of the stories were
self-contradictory.</p>

<p>On one side of the road was a cottage, standing by itself,
and partly screened by the shrubs which grew in the small
garden in front of it. Here the man stopped short, for the
lower windows of the cottage were open, and from within he
could hear some one singing the very song which he had just
been humming. Some one? Why, it could be no other
than Viola herself who was singing it like that! He had
always been interested in Viola, although he had seen her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
only on the stage. It was her reputation that she loved
splendour and luxury. What could she be doing in this
quiet, out-of-the-way village?</p>

<p>He leaned over the low garden gate, resting his elbows on
the top of it, and listened until the song&#8217;s conclusion. The
room in the cottage was brightly lighted, and the curtains
were not drawn over the window; he had heard rightly; it
<i>was</i> Viola. He could see her distinctly. She was standing
with her face towards the garden; and the man watched
her attentively. The mystery increased. Her dress was
brilliant, not the dress that a woman would put on in solitude
and in a country village. She was wearing her diamonds
too&mdash;those diamonds about which every story had been told
except the true one. What was the reason for it all? Was
this simply her passion for splendour, existing even when
the splendour was to have no witnesses. The little, shabby,
taciturn old woman who acted as her companion in London
was seated at the piano, and had been playing the music for
her song. But surely Viola would not have made herself so
magnificent simply on her account.</p>

<p>It suddenly dawned on him that he was doing rather a
mean thing by watching Viola in this way. He would not
look any more, but he would wait, in case she should be
going to sing again. That was love of music&mdash;not curiosity.</p>

<p>But even as he was making this decision the door of the
cottage opened, and Viola came out. She walked straight
up the pathway towards the gate on which the man was
leaning; there was not the least hesitation about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how on earth she managed to see me in this
darkness?&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to run away.
I will wait, and make my apologies to her. I expect she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
will be angry with me. Well, she should not leave the
windows open when she sings, if she does not want people
to stop and listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she drew near to him she murmured a few words in
Italian, as if she were pleased about something; he conjectured
that much, for he could not understand Italian. Then
she astonished him by placing her hands on his shoulders,
and kissing him, once, passionately.</p>

<p>It flashed across him for an instant that she had been
expecting some one else, and had made a mistake. Now he
understood the dress, the diamonds&mdash;everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, my dear lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you are
kissing the wrong face&mdash;are you not?&#8221; He afterwards
thought that he might have expressed himself better, but
he was agitated.</p>

<p>She, on the other hand, never lost her composure for a
second. She spoke in English, with the faintest possible
stammer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, th&mdash;thanks; it <i>is</i> the wrong face. Would you
t&mdash;take it away?&#8221;</p>

<p>He retired at once, walked twenty yards down the road,
and then met the full humour of the situation. He laughed
a long, suppressed laugh. He went on and on, away from
the village, out over the heath, away from the haunts of
men. And, as he walked, the humour of the situation
vanished again; but the night was full of her music, her
queenliness, the fragrant charm of her presence. &#8220;Viola,&#8221;
he said softly, &#8220;Viola, what a heavenly mistake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Three years passed away. The poor but artistic man
grew slowly wealthy in those years. The exaltation of that
night never left him; he was full of brightness and happiness;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
his work was all light and strength. He grew popular&mdash;partly
by reason of his excellent spirits, and partly because
of his finer qualities. His luck was proverbially good; but
he had enough hope, optimism, and vigour to have carried
him safely through the most trying fortunes. His reputation
was at its brightest when his death came.</p>

<p>He was in an accident&mdash;a commonplace railway accident&mdash;an
accident that passed over a dishonest commercial
traveller in one compartment, and killed the artist in the
next. There was a short period, however, chiefly occupied
by delirium, between the accident and the man&#8217;s
death.</p>

<p>It was at the end of the delirium that he turned to the
friend who was by his bedside, and asked abruptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I been speaking of Viola?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; of course I wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. All the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you surprised?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have known you most of your life, and I never
heard you speak of her before&mdash;not in that way at all. I
did not know that you had been her lover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not. But once, before she left England, I was&mdash;I
was her lover&#8217;s under-study. I have lived on it ever
since,&#8221; he added, after a pause.</p>

<p>Then, through some queer freak of the brain, the humour
of the mistaken kiss appealed to him again, and he began
to laugh&mdash;uncontrollably, as if the thing had just happened.</p>

<p>Laughter was the worst thing possible for him in that
state. He died laughing.</p>



<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;I suppose she&mdash;Viola&mdash;didn&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Erato thoughtfully,
when Terpsichore had finished her story.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that she had some one else to think about.
Did you ever know a woman yet that thought twice, by way
of pity, about a man she did <i>not</i> love, when she had a man
that she <i>did</i> love to think about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N&mdash;no,&#8221; Erato replied.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause. &#8220;Personally I don&#8217;t
mind,&#8221; said Clio, &#8220;but&mdash;considering where we are&mdash;do you
think that last story quite&mdash;quite judicious?&#8221;</p>

MELPOMENE&#8217;S STORY: THE CURSED PIG.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &#8217;M rather thirsty,&#8221; said Erato to Clio. Erato had
stretched herself once more on the mosaic floor of
the cloud-room, with enough cushions to make herself comfortable.
&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Terpsichore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, considering how very hot the night is, I am not
surprised. Cupid!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little petulant boy came laughing into the room,
and nodded his head in reply to the order which Clio gave
him. Then he brought in a silver tray covered with fragile
glasses of nectar. All the Muses drank nectar except
Melpomene. She had a look of intense gloom, and she
drank blood-and-seltzer from a very large tumbler with a
very bad curse cut in Greek characters on the margin of it.
Before Cupid handed her glass to Erato, he just touched it
with his own lips. Then he sat down by Erato&#8217;s side,
playing with her long hair. &#8220;Erato,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I would
like to wrap your beautiful dark hair all around me, and
go to sleep. There&#8217;s a faint scent of those yellow roses
about it, and it&#8217;s awfully soft and warm. I love you, Erato.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to love all of us,&#8221; said Clio reprovingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I try to,&#8221; said Cupid, very soberly, &#8220;and it&#8217;s tough work
with some of them,&#8221; he added under his breath.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;Cupid, darling,&#8221; whispered Erato to him, &#8220;to-morrow I
will give you the bow-string that you wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully,&#8221; said Cupid, &#8220;and you must tell the
next story, you know, and I will lie here and listen to
it. Tell me the story again about that shepherd in Sicily
who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! hush!&#8221; interrupted Erato, &#8220;some of the sisters
hardly like that kind of story; and they say that the young
students at work in the colleges below us never think of
love, and would not care to hear about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Cupid, with some assumption of importance,
&#8220;I was there last June week on business, and
I bagged three hundred and forty-two brace. That looks
rather different, I fancy. Every man that I hit is engaged.
They write long letters to Her. They keep faded flowers
which She wore. They are beginning to drop all their
bachelor friends. One of them has made a kind of little
shrine on his mantelpiece, in which he keeps one tiny white
satin slipper that She wore, and also a large photograph of
Her. Unfortunately the virus&mdash;I mean the sweet influence&mdash;is
not always permanent. Only too often the June
week of one year undoes the work of the previous June.
I feel sure they would like to hear the story about
the Sicilian shepherd, and how he got to the cave, and
found&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Erato quickly, &#8220;that&#8217;s the most dangerous
part of all. We&#8217;ll see about it though. Clio,&#8221; she added,
raising her voice, &#8220;Cupid tells me that you must be
a little mistaken about those young students; he says
that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to have to interrupt you,&#8221; remarked Clio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
&#8220;but I have asked Melpomene to tell us a soul-moving
story, and she is going to commence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to listen to that bloodthirsty hag,&#8221;
whispered Cupid to Erato. He kissed her and passed out
of the room. Erato was busy with the curious little silver
brazier, from which the smoke began to ascend more
quickly.</p>

<p>Melpomene took a draught of her blood-and-seltzer, and
began in a deep and husky voice:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A watchman stood on a lonely tower, looking eastward,
and whistling &#8220;Wait till the clouds roll by,&#8221; shredding it in
as a remedy against impatience. And that watchman was
nothing if he was not classical.</p>

<p>He pondered upon the history of the house. For
the master was away from home, having gone to a
lonely place not marked on the maps, in order to make
atonement for his crime. Ten years before he had eaten
a veal-and-ham pie, in which, owing to the inadvertence of
the cook, his eldest daughter had taken the place of the
veal-and-ham. And the cook&#8217;s carelessness had been
entirely due to absence of mind: he was distraught
because his son had just murdered his aunt, and the son
had murdered the aunt because his mind was unhinged
owing to a sudden depreciation in nitrates, which he had
bought largely. And the gods had caused the nitrates
to depreciate because one of the directors hadn&#8217;t sacrificed
anything except one thigh slice, rather fat, for the
last two years. And the director hadn&#8217;t sacrificed anything
else, because he got his butcher&#8217;s meat under contract and
the butcher had bilked him. And the butcher had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
compelled to bilk him, because the gods had sent a
murrain on all the cattle in the world, to punish one pig
that they had a spite against. This was not quite the
ordinary curse, descending from father to son with the silver
spoons and the mortgages. It went zigzag, like a snipe.
Many people had taken snap-shots at it with sacrifices, but
they hadn&#8217;t been able to stop it. Nobody knew where that
curse was going to next; so a general interest in it prevailed.
Teiresias had taken a long prayer at it, just as it
was hopping from the director to the cook&#8217;s family, and
missed badly. And now the master of the watchman&#8217;s
house&mdash;by name Eustinkides&mdash;had fired a ten-years&#8217;
penance at it. Some thought he&#8217;d hit it; others said it was
lying low, and would get up again in a minute.</p>

<p>This distressed the watchman. He felt uneasy. It was
one of those frisky curses, with an everlasting ricochet about
it, going on like sempiternal billiards with a bad cushion.
He did not think it probable, of course, that it would hit
him. He was in such a very humble position in life. But
still he would have felt more comfortable if he could have
seen that curse getting to work somewhere else. It was not
a pleasant thing to have hanging about the house. In
the meantime he awaited the coming of Eustinkides. The
master had ordered that at the moment when he appeared
in sight the hot water should be turned into the bath.
For, during the ten years&#8217; penance in the place not
recognised by the Atlas, he had carefully abstained from all
manner of washing, and had not so much as breathed the
name of soap. Suddenly the watchman removed his eye
from the telescope, and cried: &#8220;Listen, ye that are within
the house. For on the road is a curious geological formation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
that walks, and a staff is stuck in a projecting portion
of one of its upper strata.&#8221; When it came nearer, and
within hearing, the watchman called out to it:</p>

<p>&#8220;What ho! old alluvial deposit. How&#8217;s your
ammonites?&#8221;</p>

<p>A deep voice answered: &#8220;I am thy master, Eustinkides.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! sorry!&#8221; gasped the watchman, and disappeared
abruptly. Whish! The hot water poured into the bath.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards Eustinkides lay in that bath, and
soaked. As fragments of other climates slowly detached
themselves from him, he thought of his penance and of his
journey home. He had stopped at Delphi and put himself
in communication with Zeus. &#8220;Could you tell me how to
stop this curse, Mr. Zeus?&#8221; he called up the communication
tube. He waited for some little time, and then a hollow
voice replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;One pork chop and mashed. Two in order.&#8221; At this
Eustinkides had at first been angry; but afterwards it
seemed to him that it might be a mystery. He thought of
writing to Zeus to ask for a further explanation, but there
was the difficulty about the address. He felt sure it would
not do to write:</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Zeus, Esq.</span>,<br />
<span class="indentleft2">Up Top, R.S.O.</span></p>

<p>So he dried himself slowly, and went into the study. As
he sat there, his French cook was announced, to consult
with him on the question of dinner. While they were
talking, a smell came out of the kitchen and walked slowly
upstairs; it was a strong young smell, but it was lazy. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
lounged into the study, and sat down under the King&#8217;s
nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Eustinkides, &#8220;that is very pleasant. What
is that you are cooking downstairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pork chops for myself and the watchman,&#8221; said the
cook.</p>

<p>In a moment the words of the oracle flashed across into
the mind of Eustinkides. &#8220;I also will eat pork chops,
but they must not be cut from the animal whereof my
servants eat. So go out, and catch another pig, and kill
him, and chop him, and cook him, and bring me the
result.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the cook went out, and caught a butcher who was
very careless, and demanded a pig. And the careless
butcher remembered that he had killed a pig a month or
two before, but he had entirely forgotten what he had done
with it. At last he found it in the coal-cellar, and brought
it to the cook. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit dusty,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;but that&#8217;ll
all wash off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something wrong with that pig,&#8221; said the cook
as he prepared dinner for Eustinkides.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something deuced wrong with these chops,&#8221;
remarked Eustinkides as he worked his way slowly through
them. However, he felt sure that he was doing the right
thing, and carrying out the commands of Zeus, so he did not
much mind at the time.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour afterwards he staggered into a
Chemist&#8217;s. &#8220;Give us two-pennyworth of any quick sort
of death, will you?&#8221; he gasped faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you suffering from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cursed pork,&#8221; he murmured.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>That was precisely it. The pig from which those
chops had been taken was the very pig which the gods
had such a spite against. Eustinkides was carried home
to fulfil his destiny. His last words were: &#8220;Apple sauce!&#8221;</p>

<p>So the front end of the curse run into the hinder end,
and that smashed the thing up. Wherefore let us all
reverence the name of Eustinkides, and refrain from soap
and sin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Melpomene fainted, and squirmed on the floor. I cannot
say that I was surprised. They picked her up, and gave
her a little more blood-and-seltzer, and she recovered
gradually.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tragedy <i>does</i> take it out of one,&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any more of the story, is there?&#8221; asked
Thalia.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Zeus!&#8221; all the sisters ejaculated fervently, but
in a whisper.</p>

POLYMNIA&#8217;S STORY: AN HOUR OF DEATH.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CLIO was toying with the delicate little glass from
which she had been drinking. &#8220;Before we have
the next story, one of you might sing something,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I shall be glad to play the accompaniment on the sackbut,
which is a historical instrument. We first hear of it as
being in use about the latter end of the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; said Erato, shamelessly interrupting, &#8220;I
was to tell the next story, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s have the song first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like music at night,&#8221; said Erato. &#8220;At night it has
a speaking voice, and one understands it better. And it
would be a good introduction to my story; but it must not be
a drawing-room song. They are called drawing-room songs
because they are whistled in the street. No, my song must
be good. There mustn&#8217;t be any&mdash;</p>

<div class="indent">And there&#8217;s tew more lambs in the fold.</div>
</div></div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>That sort of thing couldn&#8217;t possibly make anybody love
anybody, you know. It&#8217;s rather queer,&#8221; she continued
meditatively, &#8220;but one goes out at night all alone, and
it&#8217;s quiet, and a lot of little stars show you how big the
darkness is. You&#8217;re thinking just about ordinary things;
and without any reason there comes into your head a
bit of one of the Nocturnes&mdash;Chopin&#8217;s, the eleventh, I
think&mdash;and straightway you feel as if you&#8217;ll die unless
you kiss somebody you&#8217;re awfully fond of. And, of
course, being alone, you can&#8217;t. And so you get sorrowful.
It&#8217;s queer, because there&#8217;s nothing about love in
all that&mdash;the music, and quiet, and darkness&mdash;to make
one think about it; but one always does&mdash;at least I
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Erato!&#8221; remonstrated Clio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do. Euterpe shall sing to us now. I don&#8217;t
mind a song that can be sung in a drawing-room&mdash;it&#8217;s the
drawing-room song that I hate. But Euterpe knows all
about it, and she sings beautifully, and she&#8217;s very pretty&mdash;and
yet she&#8217;s shy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erato was quite shameless in her favouritism. But she
had chosen well. Euterpe was shy and quiet, but she
loved singing. She smiled at Erato, and seated herself at
a cottage piano in one corner of the cloud-room. I had
not noticed before that there was a piano. She refused
Clio&#8217;s offer to accompany her on the sackbut, and another
offer from Terpsichore to accompany her on the banjo.
She was quiet, but when it came to music she was firm.
The music of her song was beautiful, but owing to the
expense of printing music it is cheaper to give the
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Euterpe,&#8221; said Erato, &#8220;you must have been
thinking of Sicily. It brings it all back to my mind, how
he and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Erato paused. &#8220;Clio,&#8221; she said at last,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to tell the next story. Let one of the others
tell it. Perhaps I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t listen very much, but you must
forgive me. I want to lie here, and think, and think, with
music in my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps Polymnia has a story to tell us,&#8221; suggested
Clio.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Polymnia wore a long robe of pearly-grey; her face was
pale, and her eyes were deep and thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, in a low musical voice, &#8220;I remember a
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this is the story which she remembered:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It happened one day that Zeus was in a bad temper&mdash;a
thoroughly bad temper. When this took place the whole
of Olympus knew it. John Ganymede knew it. He had
grown respectable and middle-aged. He was inclined to
be portly, and still more inclined to give his views on
anything to anybody. Just at present he was standing in
his pantry, polishing glasses, and talking to the Deputy
Cloud-controller.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no pleasin&#8217; of him, when he&#8217;s like that,&#8221; said
Ganymede, shaking his bald respectable head. &#8220;Last
night he was suthin&#8217; awful. &#8216;Ganymede,&#8217; he says to me,
when I brings him his whisky last thing afore he goes to
bed, &#8216;you can pour it out for me.&#8217; So I does. &#8216;And you
can put hot water in it.&#8217; So I does again. &#8216;I think a
couple of lumps of sugar would improve it&mdash;and a little bit
of lemon peel&mdash;don&#8217;t you, Ganymede?&#8217; &#8216;Yessir, suttinly
sir,&#8217; I says, and puts &#8217;em in. &#8216;Grate a little nutmeg on the
top.&#8217; I were surprised, o&#8217; course, but I did it. &#8216;Stick a
couple of spoonfuls of Maraschino into it.&#8217; All this time
he&#8217;s lookin&#8217; as quiet and gentle as a hangel. There wasn&#8217;t
no Maraschino, and I had to go down to the cellar and fetch
it. I measures it out careful, and says nothing. &#8216;I&#8217;ll have
a large lump of ice in it, and two straws.&#8217; I thought his
poor &#8217;ead must be going, but it wasn&#8217;t my place to make no
remarks. I just carries out the horder. &#8216;Have you done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
all that, Ganymede?&#8217; he asks, drowsy-like. &#8216;Yessir, suttinly
sir,&#8217; says I. &#8216;Well, there,&#8217; says he, &#8216;you&mdash;several blanks&mdash;now
you can run round, and see if you can find a dog that&#8217;s
such a Zeus-forsaken fool as to drink it&mdash;because I ain&#8217;t
going to.&#8217; And with that he goes off into his bedroom,
screamin&#8217; an&#8217; laughin&#8217; an&#8217; swearin&#8217; like a maniac. Now
that ain&#8217;t no way to be&#8217;ave.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Deputy Cloud-controller could sympathise. That
very morning Zeus had sent for him, and demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the wind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Due East,&#8221; said the Deputy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then make it due West.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Deputy bowed, retired, and made it due West.
In ten minutes&#8217; time he was summoned before Zeus
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it East and West and South and North all at
once,&#8221; said Zeus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said the Deputy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then consider yourself discharged,&#8221; roared Zeus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then consider <i>yourself</i> a blighted idiot,&#8221; replied the
Deputy indiscreetly, getting ready to dodge a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I do,&#8221; said Zeus, who never was very expected.
&#8220;Go away, and send me some one else to be angry with.
You&#8217;re stale.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Deputy Cloud-controller had found some difficulty
in getting any one to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I to do, Mr. Ganymede?&#8221; said the Deputy
despairingly. &#8220;They all say that it&#8217;s more than their lives
are worth. And the females won&#8217;t stand his language.
I must send some one, or I shall get discharged in real
earnest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;Well, pussonally,&#8221; said Ganymede, &#8220;I should be very
glad to oblige you, but leave this &#8217;ere glass and plate I can&#8217;t.
Now, there&#8217;s the Clerk of the Curses. He&#8217;s pretty tough.
Why don&#8217;t you send him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I would,&#8221; said the Deputy, &#8220;but he&#8217;s away on his
holiday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s the Earth-child,&#8221; suggested Ganymede,
looking a little ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>No one quite knew how the Earth-child had come
among the gods. There must have been a mistake somewhere;
it was pretty generally known that she was to have
been born in Arcadia. There was something of a scandal
about it, too. But there she was, generally petted and
liked, and happy enough among the gods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s the Earth-child,&#8221; said the Deputy, and he
too looked a little ashamed of himself. They talked together
a little while longer, and then the Deputy went away,
suffering badly from conscience.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards the Earth-child walked fearlessly
into the hall where Zeus was seated. She had
red hair, and an intelligent face. She was bright, and
affectionate, and twelve years old, and not afraid of
anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you wanted to be angry with me, Zeus,&#8221; said
the child.</p>

<p>Zeus looked at her grimly. &#8220;I should prefer something
rather bigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you want to be angry?&#8221; the child asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve done everything, and know almost everything,
and I&#8217;m quite sick of everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Music?&#8221; suggested the child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;Sick of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything&mdash;everything, I tell you,&#8221; said Zeus hastily.
&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of eating, drinking, loving, hating, sleeping,
walking, talking, killing&mdash;everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for you, Zeus,&#8221; said the child, with a sigh.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you die?&#8221; she suggested afterwards, seriously.</p>

<p>Zeus frowned. &#8220;No, no&mdash;not that,&#8221; he said. There
was a moment&#8217;s pause. Zeus was thinking; and, as he
thought, his face grew very ugly. He was immortal, but to
a certain extent his immortality was conditioned. He might
die at any moment he chose, and remain dead for an hour.
If at the end of that hour any one would put his lips on the
lips of Zeus, and draw in his breath, then Zeus would come
back to life, and he that so drew in his breath would die.
But if no one did that, then Zeus himself would be dead
for ever. Zeus had never ventured on the experiment; he
knew that no one loved him enough. But he might play on
the simplicity of the child. And take her life? No, he
could not do that. But he would ask her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Earth-child,&#8221; he said, &#8220;will you do something for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Zeus&mdash;anything that will make you happy again.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was horribly tempting. Should he try this one thing
of which he knew nothing, of which he was not tired?
Yes, he must.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to sleep,&#8221; he said rapidly. &#8220;I will turn this
hour-glass here, and when the last grain of sand is running
out, you must put your lips to mine and draw in your breath.
Then I shall wake up again, and be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child stared at him with wondering eyes. &#8220;I will
do it,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>A minute afterwards Zeus was lying dead, and the child
was watching him, and in the hour-glass the sand was
running out slowly. Time passed, and the child, as she
watched, saw that his face was changing queerly. It was not
quite like the face of one who slept. Suddenly she crept to
his side, and put one hand over his heart. It was motionless.
&#8220;Zeus!&#8221; she called, in a loud whisper. He did not
answer, and she knew then that he was dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;But shall I wake him?&#8221; she said, watching the running
sand.</p>

<p>As the last grains ran out, she bent over him, and did
what he had said. He sat up with a gasp, and a look of
horror died slowly out of his face. And the child lay prone
on the floor, face downwards.</p>

<p>Zeus hardly thought of her. &#8220;Take that away,&#8221; he said
to Ganymede, who entered the hall just then. Ganymede
went pale to the lips, but he lifted the white burden in
his arms, and carried her out. &#8220;I wish we hadn&#8217;t sent
her,&#8221; he sighed to the Deputy Cloud-controller; &#8220;I would
have gone myself, if I&#8217;d known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you had,&#8221; said the Deputy. &#8220;Both of us
together are not worth her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeus had forgotten her. He could think only of the
things he had known in that horrible hour. &#8220;I will never
die again,&#8221; he said to himself; and for many nights he
could not sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;The weather&#8217;s rainy,&#8221; said the Muse of Astronomy, who
had drawn a curtain back and was looking out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but Urania,&#8221; murmured Terpsichore, knowing it
was wrong, but quite unable to help it.</p>

CALLIOPE&#8217;S STORY: THE LAST STRAW.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF Euterpe had happened to have been born a pronoun,
she would not have been demonstrative or personal.
She would have been self-possessive. With all her shyness,
she had herself perfectly in hand. She always was a little
in love with somebody, but that was a secret she never told
herself. Some gentle reason guided all that she did. And
now for some little time she had been watching Erato, who
was stretched in her favourite attitude on the floor of the
cloud-chamber.</p>

<p>Now Erato had not even pretended to pay the slightest
attention to Polymnia&#8217;s story. She was thinking&mdash;and
thinking. She thought easiest when she was lying on her
back. Her hands were clasped behind her head, and she
looked upwards with wide-opened eyes. You never saw
such eyes. They told one half the story, how&mdash;with all
her waywardness and petulance and laughter&mdash;love was
the life of her. And now, as she lay dreaming, it seemed
that it was noon in Sicily, and the flocks were sleeping;
and he rested in the shade&mdash;he, the shepherd&mdash;singing.
And now, again, the noon had passed and the night had
fallen; in the dim cavern the air was fragrant and cool;
one heard no footsteps on the thin white sand; she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
nothing to him, nor he to her, for all was said and sleep
was near; only for a little while they listened, and heard
the great sea singing its song eternal. And it all was over
and gone. For the gods are dead, and the steam-roller
goes about the streets; and we are all either brutes or prigs,
and most of us are both, and there is no more love-making.
I, of course&mdash;a spiritual nature, very highly civilised&mdash;can
see that we live in an age of progress and omnibuses, and
can be thankful for it. But Erato, poor child, did not
take many things seriously&mdash;only love and the service of it.
And it happened, every now and then, that some such fit
of despondency or fierce sorrow would capture her as had
captured her now. Of late this had been happening too
often. To-night it was the song which Euterpe had sung
that had set her pondering&mdash;now thrilling her with some
exquisite recollection, now saddening her as she thought of
the present time, the epoch of the brute and the prude. It
was half-pitiful to watch, as Euterpe was watching, and to
see the laughter all die away from those red lips, and the
eyes grow liquid and suddenly close, and the tightening of
the little hands, and the hurried breathing.</p>

<p>Euterpe was not demonstrative. So it was the more
to her credit that she left her place, and sat down on the
cushions by Erato&#8217;s side. She did not say anything to her.
She only did one or two of those gentle things that a girl
will do&mdash;a touch of the hand&mdash;a caress. And suddenly
Erato buried her head in Euterpe&#8217;s lap, and clung to
her and sobbed quietly. I suppose Euterpe had the
sympathetic way. Some dogs have it: you are sitting
before your fire, alone, smoking, thinking of your bills or
your badness, or anything unpleasant, and you murmur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
a few bad words; the big dog gets up, shakes himself, and
thrusts his cold nose into your hand and whines dejectedly.
Then you have to slap his back genially, to make him see
that it is not his fault.</p>

<p>I do not think Clio can have noticed what had happened,
for she said briskly:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, Erato, we will have your story. The young
men in Cambridge must be all in bed and asleep, so it
won&#8217;t hurt them. You must not spoil it by leaving
anything out. Let it be the story of you and the shepherd,
you know&mdash;and don&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clio, Clio,&#8221; said Euterpe quickly, &#8220;can&#8217;t you see that
Erato is ill? Please go on quickly, and let Calliope tell her
story. When that is finished, Erato will be all right again.
She has been worrying herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not often that Euterpe said so much, and so
authoritatively. Her eyes were bright: almost there were
tears in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be glad to recite to you,&#8221; said Calliope, &#8220;a
poem in thirty-five cantos, with two thousand stanzas to
the canto, heroic metre, classical subject&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Swivel-action and no escapement,&#8221; Thalia went on,
under her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; said Clio, &#8220;that we shall not have time for
all that, much as we should like to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, quite so,&#8221; added Terpsichore, a little maliciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would read us the synopsis now,&#8221; suggested
Clio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or the index,&#8221; said Thalia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or even the advertisements at the end,&#8221; Terpsichore
proposed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;I will read you no poem whatever,&#8221; said Calliope
severely. &#8220;<i>You are not&mdash;not yet ripe for it.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we are very crude,&#8221; sighed Thalia to Terpsichore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you instead a perfectly true story, quite
unadorned and not at all epic. When you get a little riper,
I will read you one of my own poems, but not to-night.
To-night you have to put up with the following drivel.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the drivel which they had to put up with:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was once a man, an Athenian, who was the
opposite of all that he wanted to be. The gods had made
him for a joke, and a very good joke he was; but as a man
he was a failure.</p>

<p>To start with, he desired to have a perfect body and then
to despise it. He wanted to be beautiful, and strong, and
think nothing of it. Yet he thought a good deal of the bent
piece of ugliness which was the nearest he could do to a
perfect body. For he had nothing he wanted, and could do
nothing he wanted. Sometimes he made good resolutions
and tried to lead a fine life; then the gods dug one another
in the ribs, and rolled about Olympus gasping with laughter.
They knew very well that they had taken unusual pains
about that man&#8217;s physical composition; they had afflicted
him with several hereditary taints; they knew that he might
make enough good resolutions to pave the whole of&mdash;well,
Westminster Abbey, and that it was a physical
impossibility that he should keep any of them. &#8220;Let this
man,&#8221; one of the gods had said to Zeus, shortly before the
failure was born, &#8220;be cowardly, sensual, and brutal.&#8221; Then
Zeus said that he was tired of making that sort. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; the
other god urged, &#8220;but we&#8217;ll give him at the same time the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
emotions and aspirations of a noble mind. Then we shall
see soul and body fighting, and the soul will get thrashed
every time.&#8221; &#8220;Now, that <i>is</i> something like sport,&#8221; Zeus had
remarked, as he gave the necessary order.</p>

<p>So this man went on providing amusement for gods and
men until he was twenty-five years of age. Sometimes he,
unfortunately, was quite unable to laugh at himself. Then
he wrote verses. At other times he laughed at himself
very well&mdash;often in self-defence, because it made other men
let him off easier&mdash;and then he would tear his verses up.</p>

<p>On that last day he lay in bed in the morning and
shivered. He had slept for a little while&mdash;he had seen to that
before he went to bed&mdash;but he was wide awake now, and
his head was burning, and his thoughts were of the kind
that tighten the muscles of the body and are likely nowadays
to lead on to padded rooms. For the day before he had
been found out; one act of fatal cowardice on his part&mdash;such
cowardice as no one could forgive&mdash;had cost a girl her
life, and this girl was the sister of his own familiar friend.
There was plenty of variety about his thoughts. Sometimes
he felt like a murderer. Sometimes he heard the dead
girl&#8217;s brother speaking awful things to him, contemptuous,
heart-broken words. There was no hope of concealment,
no pretty story that he could tell. It had all been seen
and known. In his dreams that night he had been through
the whole scene again, but his own part had been altered.
In his dream he had been equal to the occasion&mdash;taken the
plunge, rescued the girl, and been welcomed with praise
and honour, and he had walked back through the streets
of Athens feeling more happy than a god. Suddenly he
awoke and recalled the facts. The girl whom he had loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
was dead&mdash;dead through his own cowardice. It was such
loathly cowardice that he shuddered to think of it. All
men would hate him, and yet their hatred would be nothing
to his own hatred for himself. Every thought was a torture,
a knife that went into his heart and brain, fiercely and with
regular beat, stabbing and stabbing.</p>

<p>He sprang from his bed, and dressed himself hurriedly.
The house seemed to him to be strangely quiet. He
called&mdash;in a parched, husky voice&mdash;and no one answered.
All had left him: the very slaves had run away from such
a master, and he was alone. No one, he thought, would
come near him now. He had served as a laughing-stock
for his friends: he was now too despicable to be laughed at.
If you wish the villain of your drama to be hissed as villain
was never hissed before, make him during the first two acts
the low comedian of the piece.</p>

<p>The man was trembling and shuddering. He made a
small fire, and crouched down by it. Ah, if he only had
it to do again! A million deaths were better than such
torture as this. An impulse&mdash;irresistible almost&mdash;came
over him to shriek aloud and to tear with his hands at
something. Could he be going mad? The thought
horrified him. He fetched wine, and drank it, and tried
to calm himself, crouching down by the fire again.
Suddenly he heard footsteps, and presently one of his
old companions&mdash;and the worst man in Athens&mdash;stood
before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cur!&#8221; said his old companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me alone!&#8221; gasped the crouching figure.
&#8220;Leave me alone, or I will kill you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that you dare not touch me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>The coward knew it. It was true. The long knife
which he had grasped fell from his fingers. &#8220;Leave me,&#8221;
he cried again piteously; &#8220;you can say nothing of me which
I have not said of myself. You cannot hate me as I hate
myself. Leave me! leave me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, with a gesture of disgust and contempt, the worst
man in Athens left him. And now the strength of the
wine mastered the coward, and he slept. This time dream
followed dream, and every dream was cruel. It was late
in the evening when he awoke. The only light in the
room was that which came from the dying embers of the
fire. By that light he saw to his horror the figure of a
child standing there&mdash;a white-faced child, with awe in her
eyes&mdash;the younger sister of the girl whose death his
cowardice had caused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a message for you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;As I slept
this afternoon she came to me, and bade me tell you that
she knows all about it, and that you could not help it;
the gods made you so; for the gods are strong, and it is
fitting that we should be very patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crouching coward said nothing.</p>

<p>Then the child came quickly to him and kissed his ugly
face. &#8220;I am very sorry, very sorry for you,&#8221; she whispered
gently; and then she crept gently away.</p>

<p>The coward burst into tears, and, grasping the long
knife once more, staggered into an inner chamber, and
drew the curtain behind him. The child&#8217;s kiss was the
thing that had just turned the balance. From the inner
chamber there was the sound of one who fell heavily,
and then all was still&mdash;very still indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst of making that sort,&#8221; Zeus remarked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
with a jerk of his thumb in the direction of that inner
chamber, &#8220;is that they so seldom last. But they are
certainly funny. Personally, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t sleep for laughing
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Would you mind,&#8221; said Euterpe quietly, &#8220;drawing
back that curtain from the front of the room? A few
minutes ago Erato fainted, and I can&#8217;t bring her round
again. I think the cool night air might revive her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Terpsichore drew back the curtain, grumbling to herself.
&#8220;Just like her&mdash;we shall have the whole place turned into
a regular hospital again, I expect.&#8221;</p>

THALIA&#8217;S STORY: THE CAMEL WHO NEVER GOT STARTED.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ERATO soon recovered consciousness, although she
did not regain the spirit which she had shown at
the commencement of the evening. She leaned, white and
listless, on a pile of cushions. Cupid had brought her
water to drink; and now he waited, seated on the floor, his
knees drawn up to his chin and his hands clasped over
them, gazing lovingly and sadly at his dear Erato, or downward
in sheer dejection at the mosaic. Euterpe, at Erato&#8217;s
request, had gone to the piano. For some time she sat
playing nothing in particular with great feeling and much
expression; but she went songwards in the end, as she
always did. As far as I can remember the words, they
were something like this&mdash;it is called &#8220;Malcontent&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At Somerset House in the noontide hour, and close to the roar of the Strand,</div>
<div class="verse">The kind policeman looks to the sky with a piece of bread in his hand,</div>

<div class="indent8">Would that I might a pigeon be,</div>
<div class="indent8">For some one on earth to care for me!</div>
<div class="indent22">Heigh-ho!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And when they&#8217;ve had enough of crumbs they turn and fly away,</div>
<div class="verse">Upward and onward through the smoke, and they see the city grey,</div>
<div class="verse">Like a rotten peach that is stuffed with flies on a stifling summer&#8217;s day.</div>
<div class="indent8">Had I but wings I would fly afar,</div>
<div class="indent8">Where no disgusting cities are.</div>
<div class="indent22">Heigh-ho!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
<div class="verse">But the waiter brings the bill of fare and spreads it in front of me,</div>
<div class="verse">And pigeon-pie at one-and-four&#8217;s the first thing that I see;</div>
<div class="verse">Imagine what the effect of this on my young soul must be.</div>
<div class="indent8">Almost I would that I had died,</div>
<div class="indent8">And were under the crust with my feet outside!</div>
<div class="indent22">Waly! Waly! Waly!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;These verses,&#8221; said Euterpe in apology, &#8220;were written
by a young man in London, who was forced to live in
town, but would have preferred to have driven the cows
to pasture, and to have made wreaths of buttercups to
twine in his beautiful hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had he beautiful hair?&#8221; asked Erato softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no; that was the difficulty,&#8221; answered Euterpe.</p>

<p>Then she came and sat by Erato again, blushing at
having spoken so much. And Erato made a good deal
of her, as she always did.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite well again now, Euterpe,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; sighed Euterpe, &#8220;but this happens every
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every night you swoon away,&#8221; added Cupid.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am quite well now, and I will never be ill any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Clio, &#8220;perhaps you would tell us your
story now. Love stories suit the small hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am afraid Clio had wanted to hear that story all the
time. But she was the incarnation of outward propriety,
and had struggled against her wishes. And now it was
Erato who was unwilling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; she said in a low voice. &#8220;I could have done
it before&mdash;earlier in the night&mdash;but now it reminds me of
too many things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Clio rather snappishly, &#8220;I will ask Thalia.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Thalia had a good-humoured smile, and a very pleasant
voice, but her story was nothing more than the following:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was once a camel who had got sick of the
menagerie business. And this was pardonable, because
the menagerie had now been on tour for six weeks, and
the trombone in the band had been out of tune all the
time. There were other things that made the camel weary.
The untamed tigress had a bad cough, and kept him awake
at night. The showman had called him the ship of the
desert at each performance, and he wanted to be called
something else for a change. On one occasion he had
been lying in motionless dignity, and a little boy in a
tight suit had asked if he was stuffed. He had been
kicked by his keeper, ridden by children, starved by the
manager, and jested upon by young men with penny
cigars, who sucked intermittent oranges and called one
another Chollie. He was sick of the menagerie business,
and he wanted to get out of it. So he made himself
disagreeable. As he was passing the band-stand one
night, he reached out his great neck and ate the trombone
part to &#8220;Nancy Lee.&#8221; This made him want to be
a sailor and sing &#8220;heave-ho&#8221; during the rest of the term
of his natural life. But where was the sea? He&#8217;d got no
sea. He hadn&#8217;t an notion, as people say. So he gave up
his mind to being disagreeable again. He knocked down
a beautiful child with golden hair, and trod on her, so that
she died; and the management had to send her parents a
gratis admission before they&#8217;d stop grumbling. Then the
camel took up his position in front of the lion&#8217;s den, and
said sarcastic things to the lioness. This enraged her; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
not being able to reach the camel, she ate a portion of the
lion-tamer, to show her spirit. Finally he walked up to one
of the elephants who had a dummy tusk, and did a little
comic dentist business, insomuch that the audience jeered
at the showman, and the showman said several things
which were not set down in the printed guide to the
show. That night the camel kicked his keeper, out of
reciprocity, and then talked very high talk indeed in the
still midnight hours to a hyena who had seen the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going away,&#8221; the camel said, with a pathetic gasp
which was the nearest he could do to a sigh. &#8220;My soul
is being stifled&mdash;quite stifled&mdash;in this place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the bread,&#8221; said the hyena decidedly. &#8220;We get
nothing but bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>not</i> the bread,&#8221; snapped the camel. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
smell, and the low social status of the audience. I am
going to seek peace and culture in another clime. I am
not happy here; there can be no true happiness in a tent
which smells of thirty-four distinct species, and penny
cigars on the top of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you&#8217;ll find them&mdash;the peace and culture.
I&#8217;m not much on pilgrimages myself, but I believe the
first thing to do is to get started. Start away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said the camel. So he wandered slowly out of
the tent, and was fetched quickly back again, and tied up,
and treated with ignominy. He tried it again on the
following night, and was kicked till he was more grieved
than he could express. He tried it a third time, and
then the menagerie management sold him to a circus.</p>

<p>Now, at the circus, the camel was at first exceedingly
proud, because he walked in the procession, and cab-horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
shied at him; but afterwards he grew very lonely, for want
of other wild beasts with whom he might converse. But at
last the circus people bought an ostrich that was very cheap
because it had consumption, and the camel&#8217;s heart was
lightened. Now the ostrich was a great romancer, and
told stories of passion and bulbuls, of rivers and deserts.
And the camel listened to all these stories with glowing
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I once,&#8221; he said confidingly, &#8220;was going to start on
a pilgrimage to find culture, but I was prevented. And
after all it would surely be better to return to my old home
in the desert and taste the sweets of domesticity.&#8221; Now
the camel had been born in the menagerie, and knew
nought of the desert, but he was nothing if he was not a
talker.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall lie under the palm-trees, and crop the cocoanuts;
plunge into the hot white sands for air and exercise;
and I shall take a wife, and she shall build herself a nest,
and sit in it, and lay eggs in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir!&#8221; said the ostrich with a blush.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then my family will gather round me in the winter
evenings, and we shall play round games, and go to bed
early, and regularly enjoy ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you start on your pilgrimage in search of
domesticity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall start, wind and weather permitting, to-morrow
at one pm.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he did not start then, because he ate of circus
bread, which was so exceedingly diseased that he fell
on a bed of sickness. And the circus company saw
that he would die, and advertised him for sale very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
cheap. And he was bought by an ardent young curate
who had an enthusiastic but indistinct idea that the poor
beast might be utilised to illustrate a lecture on the Holy
Land.</p>

<p>Now the curate was a very humane man, and lodged the
camel meanwhile at a livery stable. And while he was
writing a sermon against all manner of pride, that night
a message came to him from the livery stable to say that
the camel had very bad spasms, and had kicked a large
hole in the ostler. The curate, from force of habit, sent
the poor quadruped a pound of tea, a bottle of port, and
a tract called, &#8220;Mother&#8217;s Mangle; or, Have you a Penny for
the Ticket?&#8221; The ostler drank the port, and the camel
ate the tea. So much tea made him very nervous, and out
of compassion they put a cat in the stable to keep him
company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleased to meet you,&#8221; said the cat. &#8220;Will you sing
something?&#8221; The cat knew perfectly well, of course, that
camels cannot sing; it wanted to make the animal return
the polite inquiry, and so get a chance of letting off an
erotic song which it had learned in the stables. But the
camel was not such a fool as that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dislike music,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I went in search of
culture, and never got started. I also went in search of
domesticity, and never got started. I am now going on
a third pilgrimage,&mdash;but it will not be in search of
music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like milk?&#8221; said the cat rather inconsequently.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the camel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like being scratched under the left ear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the camel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Can you catch mice and kill them slowly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said the camel, now justly irritated, &#8220;you&#8217;re
not the Catechism, and you&#8217;re not the Census; what&#8217;s the
point of all these questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going,&#8221; replied the cat, rather aggrieved, &#8220;to
suggest some object for your pilgrimage, and I wished to see
what you liked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said the camel, &#8220;I&#8217;ve quite made up
my mind. I am going to search for death. I shall start, if
the tide serves, at six a.m. to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t, because he died that night. And as he
arrived without ever starting, it has been argued by some
that he must have been a genius. If he had stuck half-way
without ever arriving, he would have been only a camel of
considerable talent.</p>

<p>But these things may be otherwise. Things generally
are.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Has that story got an inner meaning?&#8221; asked Terpsichore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Thalia.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Thalia.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do know, you ought to say,&#8221; remarked Clio.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think the story is quite&mdash;quite&mdash;well, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Thalia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor do I,&#8221; said Terpsichore.</p>

<p>They were just going to quarrel a little more, when
Euterpe exclaimed: &#8220;Look, Erato, the dawn is breaking;
it is already a little lighter in the East.&#8221; She added gently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
after a pause, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you had better go to bed
now, Cupid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Cupid, &#8220;I want to stay with my darling
Erato. I love you, too, Euterpe, but I love Erato more
than anything else in the whole world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come and kiss me&mdash;again, and again,&#8221; said
Erato.</p>

URANIA&#8217;S STORY: NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND THREE.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;YES,&#8221; said Clio, &#8220;it will soon be morning. There
will be time only for one more story. Urania shall
tell it to us. Do you not think that you had better go and
rest now, Erato? You look so tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am tired,&#8221; answered Erato, &#8220;but it is not the tiredness
that wants sleep. And I should like to hear Urania&#8217;s
story.&#8221; She was very pale; dark shadows lay under her
burning eyes; her face seemed spiritualised. Her ways
and her voice were subdued and gentle now. The brightness
and vivacity were gone. Sometimes she would look
lovingly up into Euterpe&#8217;s eyes, or touch caressingly
Cupid&#8217;s curly hair. For the most part she lay motionless,
and seemed to be looking fixedly at something&mdash;some vision
unseen by her sisters.</p>

<p>But Cupid never ceased to look earnestly at her, with
trouble on his pretty, boyish face. And all of them felt the
strange nervous tension of those who have watched far into
the night; an excited tremor came over them, bringing with
it flashing, vivid imaginings. There was a pause, a silence
that was like a prayer to the dawning light. Then Terpsichore
arose, with no merriment, as of old, upon her
face, but a look of eager penitence. And she knelt down
by Erato&#8217;s side, and whispered&mdash;so softly that only Erato<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
might hear it&mdash;&#8220;Forgive me, Erato, forgive me! I did
not love you once as well as I love you now. I was half
jealous because you seemed to like Euterpe better than you
liked me, and because you were so beautiful. But I do
love you now&mdash;I love you more than I can say. Oh, forgive
me, Erato!&#8221;</p>

<p>Erato kissed her on the lips, and Terpsichore went
back to her place, crying a little, for no particular reason,
and hoping that no one noticed it, after the manner of
maidens.</p>

<p>Suddenly Urania spoke, with a deep thrill in her voice.
This was her story:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was once a man who was very careful. He
saluted the sun, spoiled a good floor by making libations,
sacrificed freely, and learned by heart what enabled him to
remember the distinction between the <i>dies fastus</i> and the
<i>dies nefastus</i>. In fact, he did all that could be done. And
his number in the books was number one hundred and
three.</p>

<p>Now, at the end of the quarter, Zeus &amp; Co. were going
through their books. It was wearying work and dry work.
Ganymede was in and out of the office all day with liquors,
and Mercury had been run off his legs with messages to the
different departments. The clerk was reading out the items
in a dreary monotone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Number one hundred and one. Dead. Cholera.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a capital cholera,&#8221; murmured Co., &#8220;and did
its work well. Go on, clerk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Used to live in Eub&#339;a. Killed to spite his sister,
because she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Zeus hurriedly; &#8220;I remember that case&mdash;a
stupid woman, a very stupid woman&mdash;but pretty. Next,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Number one hundred and two. Philosopher still
living because he wants to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say &#8216;usual formula&#8217; when we come to that. It&#8217;s no
good wasting time. Has number one hundred and two got
anything unpleasant the matter with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then&mdash;let me see&mdash;we&#8217;ll give him a couple of
ulcers. Mercury, just look in at the Punishment Department,
and order a couple of large ulcers to be sent to
number one hundred and two, and look sharp back. Next,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Number one hundred and three. Living and prosperous.
Regular in his righteousness. Further details at the Virtue
Record Department.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to give that man some other reward,&#8221; said
Zeus, who sometimes suffered from a slight twinge of justice
in damp weather.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that,&#8221; said Co., who was very healthy,
and never got a touch of justice in any weather. &#8220;I hate a
man who does everything right. It&#8217;s so infernally hypocritical.
Besides, it shows a commercial mind. He only
does it in order to get something by it. I hate a commercial
mind. I&#8217;ll guarantee he doesn&#8217;t do it out of affection
for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeus sniggered. &#8220;Well, well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;affection, you
know, affection&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But here he was interrupted by the
arrival of Mercury.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look in at the Virtue Record,&#8221; said Co., &#8220;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
bring the detailed list for number one hundred and
three.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mercury was back again in a minute. &#8220;The Virtue
Record office is shut, sir, nobody ever virtuous after lunch,
sir&mdash;shuts at one, sir. The clerk&#8217;s gone home and taken
the keys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Co., &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t matter. The man is
obviously a hypocrite, and he&#8217;s got no business to try and
make bargains with us. I don&#8217;t mind it so much myself,
Zeus, but it <i>is</i> such an insult to <i>your</i> dignity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; said Zeus quickly. &#8220;Then he shall
repent it. I&#8217;ll teach him to call ME a pettifogging huckster.
I&#8217;ll teach him to try to bribe ME. I&#8217;ll give him a lesson.
Pass me those thunderbolts. I&#8217;ll scorch, and blight, and
blast&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gently, gently,&#8221; said Co. &#8220;We may just as well try
and get a little fun out of it. We&#8217;ll see who can torture
best&mdash;killing barred. You shall go first.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Zeus, who had plenty of force but very little skill, went
to work in the old-fashioned way. He killed the man&#8217;s relations,
burned down his house, destroyed his crops, wrecked
his ships, reduced him to poverty, and afflicted him with the
most distressing disease that the Punishment Department
had in stock. And yet the man continued cheerful, saying
that the gods were just and would yet send him prosperity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is sickening,&#8221; said Zeus; &#8220;I can&#8217;t do anything
with him. Now, Co., you try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not left me much to work on,&#8221; said Co.;
&#8220;you&#8217;ve taken away all the man has, except his baby son
and his belief in us. I will give him something&mdash;a little
accident&mdash;fever&mdash;cerebral disorder. See? Then he kills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
his child&mdash;you observe?&mdash;the child whom he loves more
than himself. Then I restore him to his senses again.
Pretty, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Zeus, a little sulkily, &#8220;you&#8217;ve won, Co.
What made you think of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Co. modestly. &#8220;It was just an
idea. He could not be tortured any worse than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; objected Zeus. &#8220;You let me
try again.&#8221; Number one hundred and three still lay
moaning on the floor of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can try, of course,&#8221; said Co.</p>

<p>Zeus still stuck to the old-fashioned plan of punishing by
deprivation. There was only one thing left to take away&mdash;the
man&#8217;s belief in the gods. So he took that.</p>

<p>Suddenly number one hundred and three arose. There
was a chill smile on his face, and he walked out into the
courtyard, and looked at the rising sun. &#8220;I was mistaken,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;There are no gods. All is as it chances.
Good is chance and bad is chance. Nothing matters any
more. I would die if I thought anything mattered. There
are no more values. It is the same thing whether I murder
my son, who is dearer than life to me, or whether I give
alms, or whether I eat my breakfast. I shall never be sorry
or happy any more. Sorrow and happiness are vain and
foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went back to his house again, and washed his
hands calmly, and broke his fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; said Zeus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Co., &#8220;you must learn the new ways. You&#8217;re
behind the times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; retorted Zeus snappishly; &#8220;you needn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
say it so loudly. I don&#8217;t want all Olympus to know
that.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;The dawn is here!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Terpsichore who spoke. She had drawn back the
curtain that formed the front of the cloud. Below them lay
the flat fen country, with dykes, and waste places, and gaunt
lonely trees. The sunrise was beautiful as a fair dream,
sprigs of light snapping on the surface of the marshy pools
and slow streams, where the cool dawn-wind shook the
water&#8217;s surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I will go to my rest,&#8221; said Clio.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the others. &#8220;And I too.&#8221; Only Erato
strove to rise and could not, and fell back, breathing
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have grown weak,&#8221; she said, and her voice was low, so
that it could hardly be heard. &#8220;I will stay here, and rest
here, in the warm light of the sun: I am cold, strangely
cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Euterpe and Cupid stayed with Erato. The rest all went
into an inner room, far within the cloud. Each as she
passed Erato had some gentle word to say to her. They
had bidden Cupid come with them; he had replied with an
angry look and a shake of the head, not trusting himself to
words.</p>

<p>So these three were left alone in the cloud-chamber.
Erato stretched out her little hands to the sun, and watched
the light come flickering over them. Cupid had drawn a
little apart, still watching her. At last her eyes closed.
&#8220;Euterpe,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;sing to me&mdash;sing the last
song. I am drowsy, and would sleep now.&#8221; So Euterpe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
went to the piano. She did not sing very well, for something
seemed to be wrong with her voice&mdash;a kind of
huskiness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent6">All&#8217;s over: fall asleep.</div>
<div class="indent6">There is no more to say,</div>
<div class="verse">There are no more tears to shed, and no more longings dead,</div>
<div class="indent6">And the watch ends with the day.</div>
<div class="indent6">Wherefore wish or weep?</div>
<div class="indent6">Close your eyes, and fall asleep;</div>
<div class="verse">And happy are the dead who sleep alway.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent6">In the fair sunlight lie;</div>
<div class="indent6">And let your sad thoughts stray</div>
<div class="verse">Through the golden gleams of the gate of dreams</div>
<div class="indent6">At the breaking of the day</div>
<div class="indent6">Wherefore wish or weep?</div>
<div class="indent6">Close your eyes, and fall asleep;</div>
<div class="verse">And happy&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Suddenly Euterpe stopped, and for a moment there was
an awful silence in the room. Then putting restraint aside,
she burst into sobs, weeping as if her heart were broken,
and flung herself down by Erato&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead? Erato, my darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Erato did not move or speak; her face was very
beautiful as the sunlight fell upon it. There was no sound
in the room but the passionate sobbing of Euterpe.</p>

<p>Cupid had risen. His face, for all its boyishness, was
firm, unmoved; only a little drop of blood was on his lip
where he had bitten it through. He looked once at his dead
Erato; then walked to the front of the cloud-chamber, and
stared vacantly outwards. It seemed to him that rings of
iron were growing tighter round his chest, and stopping his
breath. A humming sound was in his ears. He did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
quite know what was happening. Flecks of light seemed to
dart before his hot, dry eyes.</p>

<p>He had stood there a long time&mdash;he knew not how long&mdash;when
he heard a voice behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid! Cupid! you loved her too.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Euterpe, standing there pale and sweet, looking at
him, stretching her hands towards him, the tears trembling
still in her eyes.</p>

<p>And then, at last, flinging himself into her arms and
clinging to her, he wept. &#8220;Loved her! loved her!&#8221; he
cried.</p>

<p>So Erato lay there dead, and beautiful in death, and the
sun shone fiercely, because it was now day, and men were
going forth to their work.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CELESTIAL GROCERY.<br />


<small><i>A FANTASIA.</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is precisely one year to-day since the incidents
happened which I am going to record. Since that
time I have been waiting for developments. But no
developments have taken place. I find myself, in consequence,
so completely at a loss what to do or what to think,
that I venture to state the case plainly, and to ask for
advice.</p>

<p>Thomas Pigge, my old college friend, had sent me a
stall-ticket for the play. It was not often that I went to a
theatre at all; and I had never sat in the stalls before.
Pigge said in his letter that he had been meaning to come
with me, but had been prevented by a sprained ankle. I
found afterwards that this was quite untrue. Pigge, as a
matter of fact, had bought the ticket by a mistake. He
had been told that <i>The Dark Alley</i> was having a great
success. About a week afterwards he saw the advertisement
of <i>Fair Alice</i>, and as his memory is notoriously
weak, he confused the two plays, and ordered a ticket for
the wrong one. Soon afterwards he discovered what he
had done, and learning that <i>Fair Alice</i> was a dismal failure,
he offered his ticket first to his aunt and then to his
tailor, both of whom refused it. It was then&mdash;and only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
then&mdash;that he sent it on to me. I do not think this was
very nice of Thomas Pigge. I half suspected something of
the kind at the time, and I was careful to make the few
words of thanks that I sent him rather cold. I do not
suppose he noticed it.</p>

<p>When I had dressed for the evening, I rang the bell&mdash;partly
to tell my landlady that she need not sit up for me,
but also with the intention of letting her see that, although
I lived in inexpensive lodgings, I was familiar with the
mode of life of English gentlemen. She surveyed me
admiringly, and asked me if I would like a flower for my
button-hole. &#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; I said, with a smile: &#8220;they
are not worn.&#8221; I noticed with pleasure that these few
authoritative words had their proper effect. However, as I
was walking down the Strand on my way to the theatre I
saw a man, in evening dress, who was wearing a rose in his
coat, and thinking that it would be safe to follow his
example, I spent sixpence on a gardenia with some maidenhair.
The circumstance would be trivial were it not for its
bearing on after-events.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I enjoyed the piece altogether. The
house was by no means full. The few young men in the
stalls seemed mostly to know one another, and none of
them knew me. The two who came in after me had those
hats that shut up; mine was an ordinary silk hat that I
had worn for a year. This fact served to make me feel
more lonely. My fine sensibilities render me peculiarly
liable to this sort of thing; but they also do me good
service by making me notice for imitation slight shades in
the manners of the best people, which those of a coarser
mind entirely miss. For instance, I had observed that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
habitu&eacute;s of the stalls generally look a little careless,&mdash;not
reckless precisely,&mdash;but with an air of taking everything
for granted. I copied this expression throughout the
evening.</p>

<p>A man&#8217;s surroundings have a great effect upon his
character; I felt myself perceptibly refined by my presence
in the stalls. My position as an under-master in a private
school seemed unworthy of me. &#8220;It is not,&#8221; so I thought,
&#8220;the profession for a gentleman. I shall change it.&#8221; I
must have known perfectly well that it was impossible to
change it; but it pleased me to say so to myself. My old
tendencies towards economy vanished. I felt that I must
have a cab to take me home. It would cost two shillings
probably, but that would be better than an incongruity.
My &aelig;sthetic principles positively forbade me to walk home
after having sat in the stalls. So I hired a four-wheeler, as
I always mistrust hansoms. &#8220;After all,&#8221; I said to myself
as I put up the window, &#8220;what is money? We assign a
value to it, but it is relative and transitory. We don&#8217;t know
what anything&#8217;s really worth. What is money? What is
money?&#8221; The words repeated themselves over and over
again, in time with the rattling of the cab,&mdash;&#8220;What is
money?&#8221; Such a repetition is liable to send one off to
sleep. I am not sure that I might not have fallen into a
doze myself, if I had not suddenly been startled into wakefulness
by the stopping of the cab. I felt certain that the
man could not have driven to my lodgings in the time, but
I jumped out. To my amazement I found myself in an
empty street. On one side of it ran a low stone wall, on
the other there were houses; the darkness hid them to a
great extent; but the house at which my cab had stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
was brightly lighted up, and appeared to be some kind of a
shop. There was nothing set out in the windows, but over
the door were the words &#8220;Joseph, Grocer.&#8221; The street
itself was paved with blocks of crystal, and in the air there
sounded the wildest music. I turned to my cabby, utterly
at a loss as to where I was, or why I was there. He sat
absolutely motionless; his hands still held the reins, but
his eyes were shut. &#8220;Now then, cabby!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;where
have you taken me to?&#8221;</p>

<p>He made no answer, and gave no sign of having heard
me; but the horse turned its head and looked at me. As
it did so, the music ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re starring,&#8221; the horse remarked.</p>

<p>I remember perfectly well that one of the young men
with the shut-up hats had made the same remark about
some actress, and I had then wondered what he meant.
&#8220;This is very confusing,&#8221; I said. &#8220;It was the cabman that
my remarks were addressed to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look over that parapet,&#8221; answered the horse.</p>

<p>I could not help thinking how extraordinary it was to
hear a horse speak. All my life long I had been accustomed
to regard a horse as a poor dumb animal. It
might, of course, be all very well in fables to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; shrieked the horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never said anything,&#8221; I replied, indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but you thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t help thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you? If you think like that again, I&#8217;ll kick this
cab to splinters. I was shod yesterday. Why can&#8217;t you
look over the parapet, and do as you&#8217;re told?&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave in. I had an indistinct idea that I was going mad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
but I walked carefully across the polished street, and leaned
over the low stone wall. Certainly it was a marvellous and
beautiful sight. Far down, as far as my eye could reach,
there was darkness; and the darkness was strewn with
myriad golden stars. I heard the horse&#8217;s voice behind me:
&#8220;The smallest of those is the world you&#8217;ve just left, and
this is the world you&#8217;ve come to.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew perfectly well that this was impossible and quite
unscientific, and as I leaned over the wall I formed my conclusions.
I had been terribly overworked lately, and
probably part of my brain had given way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never had any!&#8221; yelled the horse, and went into a roar
of unmannerly laughter.</p>

<p>I took no notice whatever of this, but went on thinking.
These delusions must have arisen from some such partial
failure of brain-power. It was to be hoped that it was only
temporary. Probably rest and medical advice would soon
set me up again. I would step across to the grocer&#8217;s, and
inquire where the nearest doctor lived. As I crossed the
street, I noticed that the horse was humming the National
Anthem. I pushed open the door of the grocery and entered.
There were counters and shelves, but nothing on them.
After waiting a little while I ventured to tap on the floor with
my foot. A voice from the other side of the counter said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What may we have the pleasure of doing for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked, but I could not see any one, and I ventured
to say so.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t see me. It doesn&#8217;t really matter, but I
think I left it downstairs. James,&#8221; the voice called to some
invisible person at the farther end of the shop, &#8220;what did
I do with my body? I had it only this morning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>The answer came in a boyish voice: &#8220;You left it in the
cellar, Joseph, when you were packing up the nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I did, so I did. You&#8217;re right, James.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see James&#8217;s body either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you see James has only got one. You&#8217;re very
inquisitive. If you must know, his body&#8217;s gone to the
wash. You wouldn&#8217;t have him wear it dirty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I generally wash my own,&#8221; I said mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t. This is a grocery, not a laundry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must excuse me,&#8221; I pleaded, &#8220;I&#8217;m quite a stranger
in these parts.&#8221; I saw it was no good to inquire for a
doctor. If the grocery was part of the delusion, as it
seemed to be, it would be absurd to make the inquiry
there. If, on the other hand, the grocery really existed,
then probably I did not require the doctor&#8217;s services. But
I felt very muddled about it. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re Mr.
Joseph?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Joseph, and I should take it as a favour if you
would tell me with what I can serve you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;judging from the state of your counter
and shelves, I don&#8217;t see anything you can serve me
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t see,&#8221; he answered, a little snappishly.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t see the abstract. I&#8217;m not a grocer in the concrete.
Kindly shut that door. There&#8217;s a draught keeps
coming down the back of the place where my neck would
have been, and that&#8217;s a thing I can&#8217;t stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I shut the door I felt more bewildered than ever.
An abstract grocer was beyond me, and I said so. &#8220;What,
for instance, is abstract sugar?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sugar&#8217;s concrete,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;and if you abstract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
it, you get spanked. We&#8217;ve got no sugar here. If you&#8217;d
like a Pure White, Crystallised, Disinterested Love, we keep
that, although there&#8217;s not much demand. They mostly use
the coarser kinds. They say they&#8217;re sweeter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;you deal in abstract nouns then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more like it. It&#8217;s a clumsy way of putting it,
but it&#8217;s fairly right. We supply, or, to speak more accurately,
we groce, all the Emotions to the Solar System, and trade&#8217;s
very slack just now in that branch. We are doing rather
better in States of Being, and we&#8217;ve just got a new assortment
of Deaths. Now, once for all, do you intend to buy
anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>I remembered with joy that I had a couple of sovereigns
and some loose silver in my pocket. All my life long I
had suffered from want of emotional experiences. I had
always regretted the want of variety, the general flatness
and dulness. If the delusion or reality&mdash;I neither knew
nor cared now which it was&mdash;would only last, I was
determined to gratify to the full my fine perceptions.
Especially was I struck with the mention of the Pure White
Love. I may confess at once that I never got on much
with women. I have a natural dignity and reserve that is
sometimes mistaken for nervousness. I fancy it sets women
against me. Somehow I am never able to say to them
quite what I want to say. I have often looked at a young
girl, and thought that if she could only know me as I really
was&mdash;if she could once regard me as apart from wretched
circumstances, my poverty, my shabby clothes, my unfortunate
reserve&mdash;she might abate something of her pretty
scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, I intend to buy something,&#8221; I said. &#8220;To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
commence with, I should like to see some samples of that
peculiar Love you mentioned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; broke in Mr. Joseph. &#8220;How many more
times am I to tell you? You can&#8217;t <i>see</i> samples. You can
feel them if you like. James!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Joseph,&#8221; answered the boyish voice from the
further end of the shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have some of the &#8216;Pure White,&#8217;&mdash;look sharp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; continued Mr. Joseph. &#8220;Take that chair.
Adopt an easy, natural position. Don&#8217;t cross the legs. If
you find the light too strong, you can blink the eyes once
or twice, it won&#8217;t make any difference. Head a little more
this way. You&#8217;re frowning. That&#8217;s better. Now then,
we&#8217;re ready. Steady, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light certainly was too strong. A sudden flash
blinded me, and when I recovered my sight I was apparently
no longer in the Grocery. I was in a dimly-lighted conservatory
and the middle of a sentence. I have never
been able to find out what could have been the beginning
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;... which it is not, and never was,&#8221; I was saying.
&#8220;I am content only to have told you, and now I relinquish
you. Let this be my farewell, my good-bye to you before
I sail from England. In books that we read, a man would
have asked you for one clasp of the hands, or even one
kiss, but I neither ask nor wish for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up, and saw the girl to whom I was speaking.
I had certainly never seen her before, but yet the figure
was familiar. She sat in her white dress, shaded from the
light by some tropical plant. It was with passionate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
hopeless adoration that I looked at her, and yet I was full
of a strange content; it seemed to be enough to have loved
her. I saw that her head was slightly turned away from
me, and that she was sobbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;that I have made you cry. I
want you to be happy, and I know there is only one way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew it was going to be like this,&#8221; she said
tremulously.</p>

<p>For the matter of that, neither had I when I first ordered
the first sample pure white. But it struck me as being all
quite natural. Some of that peace which must come to
men of a great soul, had come to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I am not going to do anything
desperate, anything that could cause you regret. It is
enough for me to have loved you, and to feel that in
comparison the rest of my life is one....&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as I had begun in the middle of a sentence so I
ended in the middle of a sentence. The dim-lit conservatory
and the maiden vanished, and I found myself once
more in the Celestial Grocery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like it?&#8221; asked Mr. Joseph&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, hesitatingly, &#8220;it is grand, it is sublime.
But I don&#8217;t think I could stand very much of it. How
much is it a pound?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t sell it by the pound; we sell it by the spasm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take six spasms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;James, six of the pure white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said the voice of James.</p>

<p>For a moment I tried to recall the beautiful girl in white
whom I had just seen. I wondered how my first sentence
began and how my last sentence would have ended. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
seemed to have walked for a while upon those heights of
love that reach beyond the fires of passion, and on which
lie the snows of perpetual purity. I felt that my self-respect
had considerably increased in consequence. Here I was
interrupted by Mr. Joseph.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will be the next order?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often longed,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;for a little real happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Joseph. &#8220;But that is a blend. You
buy the ingredients and you blend them yourself. Unfortunately,
we do not provide Incomes. We have a Literary
Fame which gives great satisfaction. &#8216;Political Success&#8217; is in
considerable demand. Then there&#8217;s &#8216;Religious Exaltation&#8217;&mdash;not
much asked for lately, I&#8217;m afraid. &#8216;Requited Love&#8217; is
not expensive, but we&#8217;ve had complaints that it doesn&#8217;t wear
well. Of course there&#8217;s Death by Drowning, Death by&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, Mr. Joseph,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;I have no desire to die.&#8221;
I had already decided what should be my next experiment;
for even under-masters have their ambitions. &#8220;I think,&#8221; I
said, &#8220;that I should rather like to try the &#8216;Political Success.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph took my order with alacrity, and the same
process as before was repeated. Once more I seemed to
have left the grocery. I was standing on a balcony, my
hat in my hand, and below me in the street there was a
surging mass of people. As far as my sight could reach
I could see eager, excited faces upturned. I was just concluding
a speech, and, as before, was in the middle of a
sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;... not derogatory to the national sense&mdash;(cheers)&mdash;of
what is the fittest, the truest, and the best way&mdash;(renewed
applause)&mdash;of proving to those who at one time may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
thought otherwise, that, in spite of all preconceived opinions,
which, if they are not praiseworthy&mdash;and I do not say they
are so&mdash;yet may with some show of justice&mdash;(hear, hear)&mdash;be
asserted to have had their origin in a sentiment felt by
humanity at large, and more especially by the English-speaking
races, and to which we to-night, with the generosity
of the conquerors towards the conquered&mdash;(loud cheers)&mdash;can
well afford to extend our fullest indulgence. It is not
only in the family but in a man&#8217;s public capacity; not only
by the fireside, but also beneath that fiercer light that beats
upon the high offices of this nation&mdash;(loud and prolonged
cheering)&mdash;not only with the....&#8221;</p>

<p>I would have given anything to have gone on a little
further. I do not even know what my politics were,
although I am inclined to form an opinion from internal
evidences in my speech. But I never in all my life felt
such a delightful sense of exhilaration, triumph, and power.
When I came to, I found myself seated on the floor of the
grocery, perspiring profusely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was good,&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;very good!&#8221; I
picked myself up, and inquired eagerly what the price was,
and how it was sold.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is expensive,&#8221; said Mr. Joseph, solemnly, &#8220;very
expensive; and we sell it in bursts.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not like to ask for further details. I expected that
Mr. Joseph would give me a reasonable amount of credit,
and with the literary fame that I intended to buy I thought
that I should soon be able to pay for everything. But I
thought it wise to order only two bursts of the &#8220;Political
Success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Joseph,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I hardly know what to order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
next. I should like to have a price-list, and a week to
think it over. I never bought anything abstract before.
At present I&#8217;ve got only some &#8216;Disinterested Love&#8217; and some
&#8216;Political Success&#8217;; do you think you could let me have some
Literary Fame, Musical Ability, Personal Charm, Popularity,
and Contentment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a large order,&#8221; said Mr. Joseph, &#8220;but we will do
our best to execute it. James, will you see about those
articles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said James.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when shall I have them?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know when I can have them,&#8221; I continued.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hurry you. Any time in the
course of a year would do. I can give you a reference if
you like. The master of St. Cecilia&#8217;s knows all about me.
But as I did not imagine I was coming here to-night, I
have brought hardly any money with me. However, if
you would not object to taking two pounds on account&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I pulled out my two sovereigns, and laid them on the
counter. As I did so I looked up. I had ceased to be
capable of surprise, or I think I should have been surprised.
Before me, on the other side of the counter, stood a young
girl. Perhaps I should more accurately describe her as a
young angel, except that she had no wings or halo. She
was dressed in some loose, white garment, which looked
like the apotheosis of a night-gown. I could not say
within a year or two how old she was, but she seemed
to be on the verge of womanhood. Her figure was tall
and slight. Her small white hands were clasped before
her. Her face was, perhaps, a little wan and pale, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
full of the most spiritual beauty. The expression upon
it was one of sweet, calm seriousness. Her eyes seemed
to be looking sadly at something far off. Her hair was
long and dark, and fell loosely about her shoulders. I
gazed at her a long time before I could speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Joseph?&#8221; I stammered out, questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joseph and James,&#8221; she said, in a low musical voice,
&#8220;have gone downstairs to feed Joseph&#8217;s body. They sent
me up here to wait on you. What are these?&#8221;</p>

<p>She took up the two sovereigns I had placed on the
counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mere trifle,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I thought that, perhaps, it
would be better to pay a trifle on account. If I had
known that I was coming here, I would have brought
more&mdash;I would, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please put them away?&#8221; she said, slowly.
&#8220;They have no value. I will tell you about it soon. I
have known you for a long time&mdash;known you so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was entranced by her beauty, and could hardly find
words to speak, but I muttered the usual commonplaces.
It was very stupid of me, but I did not seem to recall her
face. I did not even remember her name.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;you have never seen me before.
You will know my name one day, but not yet. I have
watched you for years, and sometimes I have been with
you. I am glad that you came here to-night, for I have
often wished to speak with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is possible that I may have looked a little incredulous,
for she fixed her eyes full upon mine, leaning across the
counter, and whispered something to me. I do not see
that I am called upon to write down what she said. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
was quite personal and private. If I did record it, it would
probably be misunderstood. But it answered its purpose.
It made me feel that she knew me indeed, that here I had
no impression to make and none to mar. There was no
longer any barrier of reserve between us.</p>

<p>&#8220;And at last you have come to me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No one
can overhear us; we are quite alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>My cheeks were flushed and my voice trembled. &#8220;You
do not talk,&#8221; I said, &#8220;as the women I met on earth, nor as
Joseph and James did. No earthly woman that I know
would have whispered to me the things that you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not angry with me for it?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>I loved her for it, but I could not tell her so. For a
moment or two I gazed at her in a kind of rapture. &#8220;You
are very beautiful,&#8221; I said at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but that is not of any real consequence here.
Here the body is always beautiful, because the spirit never
spoils it. Would that I could alter your nature and make
it like ours! But they told me that you would look at me
as on your earth a man looks at a woman. I do not understand
that. I do not know your way&mdash;ah, do not look at
me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot help it; you draw my eyes towards you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not say that!&#8221; she cried, in a distressed voice.
&#8220;Do not think of it. I can think, and speak, and love
when I am not in the body. I almost wish that I had not
come to you like this. If I had been only a voice I should
still have desired you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like most people of a shy disposition, I have an occasional
access of boldness. &#8220;Do you mean that you do not understand
the kind of attraction that a woman has for a man?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Do you not know what flushed cheeks, and longing looks,
and trembling voice mean? And yet I could believe that
the earthly love would be possible to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lower is always possible for the higher,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But that is not what I want. I long to-night to teach you
the other love. But now that I am face to face with you I
have no words. There are none in any language that will
tell you. I want names for things of which you know
nothing&mdash;things which with men and women of your world
do not exist. I should feel no shame in speaking to you
of it, for there is no shame in our love. Your love is full
of shame. That was why at first I whispered to you. That
was why I told you that no one could hear us. It was for
your sake, not mine.&#8221; She stopped and sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you sigh?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I cannot say what I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is no use now. What have you been buying?&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave her a list of my purchases, and she went over
them, as it seemed to me, a little sadly. &#8220;You have not
bought the best things,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But they will cost
you all that you have here, one gardenia and a sprig of
maidenhair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that flower really worth more than the two sovereigns
that I offered you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we have none here, and flowers are the only purity
on your earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this will die in an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it would have died there, but here it
will never die.&#8221; As I laid it on the counter I noticed that
even the maidenhair was quite fresh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;If I had only known,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I would have loaded my
cab with flowers. Can I not come back again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me change the things that I have bought.
They seemed high and noble, especially the White Love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you shall change them. You did not value the
Love because it was noble, but because it made you feel
noble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what shall I buy for myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. If you had kept the goods that you ordered,
you would have made a little flutter on an indescribably
small portion of a rather insignificant world. You would
have been called the great poet, the eminent statesman, and
it would not have helped you any further&mdash;it would not
have raised you any higher. Your nature would still have
been bounded on the earth by earthly possibilities. No,
you shall buy nothing for yourself. There is only one step
that you can take that will bring you nearer me. There is
only one thing that you can do that has a real value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean self-denial,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I will obey you.
I surrender all that I had bought. You shall give me
instead the best thing for some one else&mdash;for whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For your own father.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bent my head in shame. It was a subject of which
I could hardly bear to speak; but she with great tenderness,
laying one of her little hands softly and caressingly on mine,
dropped her voice almost to a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for your father. My poor boy, there are no secrets
between you and me. There is to be no shame between
you and me. I know all. In the same asylum where your
grandfather died your father now lies. His reason is gone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
A horrible darkness has come over his mind. He lies there
moaning and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake say no more. You
are right. Give me the best thing for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be so,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And now the end of your
time here grows near. But you have taken the first step.
You and I have advanced a little further towards the sacred
unity of the new love. Come, let us go and look down at
the stars, and I will tell you about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came round to my side of the counter, and we passed
through the door together. Her bare feet trod lightly on
the crystal blocks with which the street was paved. I gazed
at her in an ecstasy of adoration. The cab was still standing
there, and the horse looked round at us. He grinned
horribly, showing his yellow fangs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my! ain&#8217;t it sweet!&#8221; he called out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You vulgar beast!&#8221; I said to him angrily, &#8220;if you
say another word, I&#8217;ll take that whip and simply flay
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t distress yourself,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;because
you&#8217;ll be asleep in two minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that she had taken no notice of the unmannerly
animal. She had crossed the street, and was leaning over
the low stone wall, with her beautiful head supported on one
hand; I saw that my most dignified course was to follow
her, and I did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, pointing downwards with her finger,
&#8220;those are the other worlds. They were put there to be
a heating and lighting apparatus for the most insignificant
of them&mdash;at least that is the prevalent creed, for the most
insignificant. Do not believe it. On each one there is life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and for each one there is a purpose; all are part of one
scheme that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The horse was quite right. At this point, I rested my
head on my arms as I leaned over the parapet, and went
fast asleep. I can never forgive myself for it, but I was
powerless to prevent it. I do not know how long I slept,
but I woke suddenly. She was no longer leaning over the
parapet; she stood on the pathway, gazing upwards, with a
strange light in her eyes. Of course she was in the middle
of a sentence. That was only part of the generally unsatisfactory
nature of everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;would get new experiences, new data. You would
think and imagine new things. You would know what the
new love means. I can only speak to you as a woman to
a man, but I do not look at you as a woman would. She
would see only a poor little schoolmaster, not very beautiful,
rather sleepy-headed, in a dress-suit much too tight for him.
I too can see that. But I see also a life that long ago
came out into the darkness hand-in-hand with mine. Had
you been placed in this world, you would have known as
I know; but I came here, and you were sent elsewhere.
Out of the same clay the potter makes two vessels, one to
honour and one to dishonour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is extremely unjust,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be quite impossible for you to think otherwise;
but you are wrong. You will soon know that you are wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the day that you know my name, when the earthly
love that you feel for me is changed to the new love of
which it is the shadow, when we come back together, you
and I, out of the darkness into the light.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;Where is the light?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look upwards. There are no more stars, and above
all seems dark. And the darkness flows on like a river,
on and on. But the river will run dry at the last, the
darkness will have passed at the last, and then we shall
enter into the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the voice of the unconscionable cab-horse
behind us, &#8220;I will ask you to join with me in singing
the last hymn on the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth,&#8221; I exclaimed testily, &#8220;is the point of
making that perfectly idiotic remark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mere absent-mindedness,&#8221; the brute answered. &#8220;I
thought from the general style of the conversation that I
was at some missionary meeting. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you need not interrupt a&mdash;a
lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady! S&#8217;help me! That high-toned, female grocer&#8217;s
assistant, a lady!&#8221; The beast positively shrieked with
laughter. &#8220;Get into the cab, you little fool, and let&#8217;s get
home. There&#8217;s no place like home.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sprang at the cab, seized the whip, and determined to
take my revenge. But I never got it. The agile beast
waltzed round and round with amazing rapidity in the
middle of the street. I struck out wildly; but though I
occasionally hit the cab, I never succeeded in hitting the
horse. All this time the cabman remained motionless.
Suddenly the brute stopped, and backed the cab right into
me. I fell down on the pavement by the low wall. I
picked myself up and gazed around.</p>

<p>She was no longer there.</p>

<p>I staggered across the road. The lights were out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
grocery. I tried the door, but it was locked. I shook
it, and called loudly, but no answer came. Once more I
turned savagely on the horse, but at the first stroke the
whip broke in my hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; he yelled, &#8220;you little fool, get into the cab,
and let&#8217;s enter into the Light!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment I stood there helpless. I felt weak and
sick with my fall. Then I flung down the broken whip,
and got into the cab, which started instantly at full speed.
I buried my face in my hands, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>When, after a moment, I looked up again, there was the
roar of the London streets about me, and we were within
a hundred yards of my lodgings. The cab stopped at
them, and I got out. It was evident that the cabman
knew nothing about what had happened; he looked cheery,
comfortable, and commonplace. I saw that there would be
no use in speaking to him about it. I merely paid him
three times his proper fare, to compensate him for the loss
of his whip, which, by the way, he did not seem to have
noticed.</p>

<p>I was very tired, and soon went off to sleep. I had lost
fame, and I had gained for my father a return to sanity. It
was worth the sacrifice. He should come to London, and
live with me. It was years since I had been able to speak
to him. Then slumber interrupted my thoughts.</p>

<p>As soon as I woke in the morning I sprang from my bed,
and took up my dress-coat. No, it was no dream. The
gardenia and maidenhair were gone, and my father had
regained his reason. Would that I could see her once
more, and thank her.</p>

<p>There came a tap at my door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;All right, Mrs. Smith,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a telegram for you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was pushed under the door. I opened it. It was
from the doctor at the asylum where my father was placed,
and it read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father died suddenly early this morning. Please
come at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>There have been no further developments, and I do not
know what to do. I feel that I must see her, and ask her.
I cannot understand. And, alas! I cannot get to her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since writing the above, I have had a letter from my
Principal. He wants my resignation. He says something
about &#8220;strangeness of manner&mdash;medical advice&mdash;real kindness
to me&mdash;hope for recovery.&#8221; Mrs. Smith has asked
me, with tears in her eyes, to leave my apartments. She
says that I have been most regular in my payments, and
in every way showed myself to be a perfect gentleman; but
the other lodgers are frightened of me, and I frighten her
sometimes. She can feel for me, because she had a cousin
who once went off like that; but would I mind going?</p>

<p>Well, I have resigned my post, and to-night I leave my
lodgings. I am very lonely.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">&#8220;BILL.&#8221;<br />


<small><i>THE STORY OF A BOY WHOM THE GODS LOVED.</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BILL came slowly up the steps from a basement flat
in Pond Buildings, crossed the pavement, and sat
down on the kerb-stone in the sunshine, with his feet in
a delightful puddle. He was reflecting.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that fuss about a dead byeby!&#8221; he said to himself.</p>

<p>He was quite a little boy, with a dirty face, gipsy eyes,
and a love for animals. He had slept the deep sleep of
childhood the night before, and had heard nothing of
what was happening. In the early morning, however,
he had been enlightened by his father&mdash;a weak man,
with a shuffling gait, who tried to do right and generally
failed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, cummere. Larst night there were a byeby come
to be your sister if she&#8217;d grow&#8217;d. But she didn&#8217;t live
more&#8217;n hour. An&#8217; that&#8217;s why your awnt&#8217;s &#8217;ere, an&#8217; mind
yer do whort she tells yer, an&#8217; don&#8217;t go inter the other
room, an&#8217; don&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; &#8217;cep&#8217; whort yer told, or I&#8217;ll break
yer &#8217;ead for yer, sure&#8217;s death, I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Bill&#8217;s father had gone away to his work, being
unable to afford the loss of a day; and Bill&#8217;s vehement,
red-haired aunt had come into the kitchen, and shaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
him, and abused him, and given him some breakfast.
Bill&#8217;s aunt was one of those unfortunate people who cannot
love one person without hating three others to make up for
it. Just at present she was loving Bill&#8217;s mother, her sister,
very much, and retained her self-respect by being very strict
with Bill&#8217;s father, with Bill himself, and with the doctor.
She instructed Bill that he was not to go to school that
morning. He was to remain absolutely quiet in the kitchen,
because he might be wanted to run errands and do odd
jobs. For some time Bill had obeyed her, and then
monotony tempted him to include the little yard at the
back in his definition of the kitchen. All the basement
flats in Pond Buildings have little yards at the back. Most
of the inhabitants use them as drying-grounds. In some
of them there is a dead shrub or the remains of a sanguine
geranium that failed; in all of them there are cinders and
very old meat-tins. Now, when Bill went out into the
yard, he found the black cat, which he called Simon
Peter, asleep in the sun on the wall. Simon Peter did
not belong to any one; she roamed about at the back
of Pond Buildings, dodged anything that was thrown at
her, and ate unspeakable things. She had formed a
melancholy and unremunerative attachment to Bill; her
name had been suggested to him by stray visits to a
Sunday-school, forced on him during a short season when
his father, to use his own phrase, had got religion.
&#8220;Siming Peter,&#8221; said Bill, as he scratched her gently
under the ear, &#8220;Siming Peter, my cat, come in &#8217;ere along
o&#8217; me and &#8217;ave some milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not at all probable that Simon Peter was deceived
by this. She must have known that, with the best intentions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
in the world, Bill could not do so much as this for her.
Yet she blinked at him with her lazy green eyes, and
followed him from the yard into the kitchen. Bill filled
a saucer with water, and put it down on the ground before
her. &#8220;There yer are, Siming Peter,&#8221; he said; &#8220;an&#8217; that&#8217;s
better for yer nor any milk.&#8221; Simon Peter put up her
back slowly, mewed contemptuously, and trotted out into
the yard again. Bill, dashing after her, trod on the saucer
and broke it, and overturned a chair. In another moment
he was in the clutches of his fierce aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to kill your blessed mother, you devil?
Didn&#8217;t I tell yer to sit quoite? An&#8217; a good saucer broke,
with the poor dead corpse of your byeby sister lyin&#8217; in the
next room. Go hout! You&#8217;re more nuisance nor you&#8217;re
wuth. See &#8217;ere. Don&#8217;t you show your ugly &#8217;ead &#8217;ere agin
afore night. An&#8217; when yer comes back I&#8217;ll tell your father
of yer, an&#8217; &#8217;e &#8217;ll skin yer alive. Dinner? Not for such as
you. Hout yer git.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Bill had been turned out, and now sat with his feet
in a delightful puddle, reflecting for a minute or two on
dead babies, injustice, puddles, and other things. It was a
larger puddle, as far as Bill could see, than any other in the
street, and it was this which made it so charming. But a
puddle is of no use to any one who has not got something
to float on it. If you have something to float on it you can
imagine boats, and races, and storms, and it becomes a
magnificent playground for the imagination; otherwise the
biggest puddle is simply a puddle, and it is nothing more.
So Bill started down the street to look for something which
would float, a scrap of paper or a straw. He was stopped
by a lanky unkempt girl with yellow hair, who was leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
on a broom that was almost bald, outside an open door.
She was four or five years older than Bill, and she was
very fond of him. The girls of the wretched neighbourhood
for the most part rather petted Bill; they did
so, without knowing their reason, because he was quaint,
and pretty, and little. He was rather dirty it was true,
but then so were they; and for the most part they were
not so pretty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; said the yellow-haired girl, &#8220;why awnt yer at
school? You&#8217;ll ketch it, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I &#8217;ont. They kep&#8217; me, &#8217;cos we&#8217;ve got a byeby, an&#8217;
the byeby&#8217;s dead. Then they tunned me out for breakin&#8217;
a saucer when I was goin&#8217; after Siming Peter what I were
feedin&#8217;, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t to &#8217;ave no dinner, and I ain&#8217;t to come
back afore night, and when I do come back I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be
walloped. I wish I was dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bill, you <i>are</i> a bad boy; what are yer goin&#8217; to
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Play ships at that puddle. I was lookin&#8217; for sutthin&#8217;
what &#8217;ud do for ships, an&#8217; can&#8217;t find nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;ll yer do about dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to &#8217;ave no dinner,&#8221; said Bill, solemnly,
&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to starve. They don&#8217;t keer. Dead byebies is
what <i>they</i> like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lanky girl leaned her broom against the wall, sat
down on the doorstep, and commenced the research of a
pocket; the pocket yielded her one penny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look &#8217;ere, Bill,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you take this and git yourself
sutthin&#8217; to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill shook his head, and pressed his lips together. He
was much moved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;I &#8217;ad it give me a week ago, and I sived it &#8217;cos there
warn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; what I wanted. So you take it. I don&#8217;t
want it. If yer like, yer can give us a kiss for it.&#8221; She
pressed it into his hand. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no other little boy
I know what I&#8217;d give it to,&#8221; she added rather inconsistently.</p>

<p>Bill nodded his head, and the lips grew a little tremulous.
He had been treated cruelly all the morning, and this
sudden change to sympathy and generosity was almost too
much for him. He kissed the yellow-haired girl&mdash;once
timidly and then suddenly with great affection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bill,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t done nothin&#8217; to &#8217;urt yer,
yer look ommust as if yer was goin&#8217; to cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Bill, finding words with difficulty,
&#8220;but&mdash;but I &#8217;ate ev&#8217;rybody in the world &#8217;cep&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he walked away with great dignity, and every nerve
in his excitable little body quivering. He felt on the
whole rather more wretched than before. The contrast
made him feel both sides of it more deeply. He had
forgotten now about the beautiful puddle and his intention
to play ships. He wandered down the main street, and
then down a side street which led behind a grim, frowning
church. And here he found something which attracted
his attention. It was a dirty little shop which a small
tobacconist and an almost microscopical grocer had used
successively as a last step before bankruptcy. It had
then remained for some time unoccupied. But now the
whole of the window was occupied with one great bright
picture, before which a small crowd had gathered. It
represented a beautiful mermaid swimming in a beautiful
sea, accompanied by a small octopus and some boiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
shrimps. Her hair was very golden and very long; her
eyes were very blue; she was very pink and very fat.
Underneath was the announcement&mdash;</p>

<p class="ph1">THE MERMAID OF THE WESTERN PACIFIC!<br />
<br />
Positively to be Seen Within!!<br />
<br />
FOR A FEW DAYS ONLY.<br />
<br />
ADMISSION ONE PENNY</p>

<p>An old man was standing in the doorway, with a tattered
red curtain behind him, supplying further details of the
history and personal appearance of the mermaid. He
looked slightly military, distinctly intemperate, and very
unfortunate, yet he was energetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;What it comes to is this&mdash;for a few days only I am
offering two &#8217;igh-class entertainments at the price of one.
The performance commences with an exhibition by that
most marvellous Spanish conjurer, Madumarsell Rimbini,
and concludes with that unparalleled wonder of the world,
the mermaid of the Western Pasuffolk. I have been asked
frequent if it pays me to do this. No, it does <i>not</i> pay me.
I am doing it entirely as an advertisement. Kindly take
notice that this mermaid is not a shadder, faked up with
lookin&#8217; glasses. She is real&mdash;solid&mdash;genuine&mdash;discovered
by an English officer while cruisin&#8217; in the Western Pasuffolk,
and purchased direct from &#8217;im by myself. The performance
will commence in one minute. If any gentleman is not able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
to stay now, I may remark that the performances will be
repeated agin this evenin&#8217; from seven to ten. What it
comes to is this&mdash;for a few days only, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Bill had seen shows of a kind before. He
had seen a &#8217;bus horse stumble, and almost pick itself up,
and stumble again, and finally go down half on the kerb-stone.
That had been attractive, but there had been
nothing to pay for it. Again, in his Sunday-school days, he
had been present at an entertainment where the exhilaration
of solid buns and dissolving views had been gently tempered
by a short address. That too was attractive, but it had
been free. And now it would not be possible to see this
beautiful buoyant creature swimming in clear shrimp-haunted
waters unless he paid a penny for it, the only penny that he
possessed. Never before had he paid anything to go anywhere.
The temptation was masterful. It gripped him,
and drew him towards the tattered red curtain that hung
over the entrance. In another minute he had paid his
penny, and stood within.</p>

<p>At one end of the shop a low stage had been erected.
On the stage was something which looked like a large
packing-case with a piece of red baize thrown over it.
There was a small table, on which were two packs of playing-cards
and a brightly coloured pill-box, and a tired fat
woman in a low dress of peculiar frowziness. As the
audience entered she put a smile on her face, where it
remained fixed as if it had been pinned. The performance
commenced with three clumsy card-tricks. Then she
requested some one in the audience to put a halfpenny
in the painted pill-box and see it changed into a shilling.
The audience felt that they had been weak in paying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
a penny to see the show, and on this last point they
were adamant. They would put no halfpennies in no
pill-boxes. They were now firm. So also was the Spanish
conjurer, and this trick was omitted. She intimated that
she would now proceed to the second part of the entertainment,
the exhibition of the mermaid of the Western Pacific.
She removed, dramatically, the red-baize cover, disclosing
a glass case. The audience pressed forward to examine
its contents. The case was filled for the most part with
those romantic rocks and grasses which conventionality has
appointed to be a suitable setting for stuffed canaries, or
stuffed dogs, or anything that is stuffed. There was a background
of painted sky and sea; and in the front there was
a small, most horrible figure, looking straight at Bill out of
hideous, green, glassy eyes. It was not the lovely creature
depicted in the window outside. It was a monstrous thing,
a contemptible fraud to the practised intelligence, but to
Bill&#8217;s childish, excitable mind a thing of unspeakable horror
and fascination. The lower half was a wilted, withered
fish; then came a girdle of seaweed, and then something
which was near to being human, yellow and waxy, with
a ghastly face, a bald head, and those eyes that would keep
looking at Bill. He shut his own eyes for a second; when
he opened them again the monstrous thing was still looking
at him.</p>

<p>There were two men standing near to Bill. One of them
was a very young and very satirical carpenter, with a foot-rule
sticking out of his coat-pocket. &#8220;So that&#8217;s a mermaid!&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;Yer call that a mermaid&mdash;oh!&mdash;indeed, a
mermaid&mdash;oh, yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; said the other man, middle-aged, cadaverous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
and dressed in rusty black, &#8220;that it&#8217;s a sight more
like a dead byeby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you <i>ought</i> to know,&#8221; replied the satirical carpenter,
grinning.</p>

<p>Bill heard this. So in that basement flat in Pond Buildings,
Bill&#8217;s home, there was something lying quite still and waiting
for him, to frighten him. He had never thought what a
dead baby would be like. His mind began to work in
flashes. The first flash reminded him of some horrible
stories which his red-haired, vehement aunt had told him,
to terrify him into being good. He had objected at the close
of one story that dead people could not walk about.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know,&#8221; his aunt had replied, &#8220;nobody
knows, what dead people can do.&#8221; In the second flash
he imagined that he had gone home, had been lectured
by his aunt, and beaten by his father, and had cried himself
to sleep. He would wake up at night, when all was quiet&mdash;he
felt sure of it&mdash;and the room would not be quite dark.
He would see by the white moonlight a horrible, yellow,
waxy thing crawling across the floor. It would not go to
the right or to the left, but straight towards him. It would
be his dead baby sister, and it would have a face like the
face of the mermaid, and it would stare at him. He would
be unable to call out. It would come nearer and nearer,
and at last it would touch him. Then he would die of
fright.</p>

<p>No, he would not go home, not until the dead baby had
been taken away.</p>

<p>As the audience crowded out through the narrow doorway,
Bill touched the man in shabby black:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, &#8217;ow long is it afore they bury dead babies?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>The man stared at him searchingly. &#8220;What do yer
want to know that for? Depends on the weather partly,
and on the inclinations of the bereaved party. &#8216;Soon as
possible&#8217; &#8217;s allus my advice, but they let it go for days
frequent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill thanked him, and walked aimlessly away. He could
not get the terror out of his mind. He walked through
street after street, so absorbed in horrible thoughts that
he hardly noticed what direction he was taking, and only
just escaped being run over. He had been wandering for
over an hour when he came across two boys, whom he
knew, playing marbles. This was companionship and
diversion for his thoughts. For some time he watched
the game with interest, and then one of the players pulled
from his pocket two large marbles of greenish glass, and
set them rolling. Bill turned away at once, for he had
been reminded of those green eyes. He imagined that
they were still looking at him; but, in his imagination,
they belonged not to the mermaid, but to the dead baby.
He wished again and again that he had never been to that
show. He was growing almost desperate with terror. Of
course, his state of mind was to some extent due to the fact
that he had eaten nothing for eight hours. But then, Bill
did not know this. Suddenly he gave a great start, and a
gasp for breath, for he had been touched on the shoulder.
He looked up and saw his father. Now Bill&#8217;s father had
drunk two glasses of bad beer during his dinner hour, and
in consequence he was feeling somewhat angry and somewhat
self-righteous, for his head was exceedingly weak and
poor. He addressed Bill very solemnly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Loit&#8217;rin&#8217; in the streets! loit&#8217;rin&#8217; and playin&#8217; in the streets!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
What&#8217;s the good o&#8217; my bringing of yer up in the fear o&#8217;
Gawd?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill had no answer to make; so his father aimed a blow
at him, which Bill dodged.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; his father continued, &#8220;I&#8217;m sent out on a
jorb, and I ain&#8217;t got the time to wallup yer now. But you
mark my words&mdash;this very night, as sure as my name&#8217;s what
it is, I&#8217;ll knock yer blawstid &#8217;ead off.&#8221;</p>

<p>At any other time this would have frightened Bill. But
now it came as a positive relief. There is no fear so painful,
so maddening, as the fear of the supernatural. The
promise that he should have his head knocked off had in
itself but little charm or attraction. But in that case he
knew what to fear and from whence to fear it. It took his
thoughts away for a few minutes from the horror of that
dead baby, whose ghastly face he pictured to himself so
clearly. But it was only for a few minutes; the face came
back again to his mind and haunted him. He could not
escape from it. He was more than ever determined that he
would not go home; he dared not spend a night in the
next room to it. Already the afternoon was closing in,
and Bill had no notion where he was to go for the night.
For the present he decided to make his way to the green;
he would probably meet other boys there that he knew.</p>

<p>The green to which he went is much frequented by the
poor of the south-west. The railway skirts one side of it,
and gives it an additional attraction to children. Bill was
tired out with walking. He flung himself down on the
grass to rest. His exhaustion at last overcame his fears,
and he fell asleep. He slept for a long time, and in his
sleep he had a dream.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>It was, so it seemed to him in his dream, late in the
evening, and he was standing outside the door of the basement
flat. He had knocked, and was waiting to be admitted.
Suddenly he noticed that the door was just ajar. He
pushed it open and entered. He called, but there was no
answer. All was dark. The outer door swung to with a
bang behind him. He thought that he would wait in the
kitchen by the light of the fire until some one came. He
felt his way to the kitchen and sat down in front of the fire.</p>

<p>It had burnt very low, and the furniture was only just distinguishable
by the light of it. As he was waiting he heard
very faintly the sound of breathing. It did not frighten
him; but he could not understand it, because as far as he
could see there was no living thing in the room except
himself. He thought that he would strike a light and
discover what it was. The matches were in a cupboard on
the right-hand side of the fireplace. He could only just
reach the fastening, and it took him some little time to undo
it. The moment the fastening was undone the door flew
open, and something yellowish-white fell or rather leapt out
upon him, fixing little quickly-moving fingers in his hair.
With a scream he fell to the floor. He had shut his eyes
in horror, but he felt compelled to open them again to see
what this thing was that clung to him, writhing and panting.
A little spurt of flame had shot up, and showed him the
face. Its eyes were blinking and rolling. Its mouth moved
horribly and convulsively, and there was foam on the white
lips. The face was close to his own; it drew nearer; it
touched him. It was wet.</p>

<p>Bill suddenly woke and sprang to his feet, shivering and
maddened with terror. The green was dark and deserted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
A cold, strong wind had sprung up, and he heard it howling
dismally. An impulse seized him to run&mdash;to run for his
life. For a moment he hesitated; and then, under the
shadow of the wall, slinking along in the darkness, he saw
something white coming towards him, and with a quick
gasp he turned and ran. He paid no heed to the direction
in which he was going; he dared not look behind, for he
felt sure that the nameless horror was behind him; he ran
until he was breathless, and then walked a few paces, and
ran again. As he crossed the road on the outer edge
of the green, a policeman stopped and looked at him
suspiciously. Bill did not even see the policeman. His
one idea was escape.</p>

<p>It happened that he ran in the direction of the river.
He had left the road now, and was following a muddy track
that led through some grimy, desolate market-gardens. All
around him there was horror. It screamed in the screaming
wind with a voice that was half human; it took shape in
the darkness, and lean, white arms, convulsively active,
seemed to be snatching at him as he passed; the pattering
of blown leaves was changed by it into the pattering of
something ghastly, coming very quickly after him. For one
second he paused on the river&#8217;s brink; and then, pressing
both his hands tightly over his eyes, he flung himself into
the water.</p>

<p>And the river went on unconcerned, and the laws of
Nature did not deviate from their regular course. So the
boy was drowned. It was a pity; for he was in some ways
a lovable boy, and there were possibilities in him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bill&#8217;s aunt was putting the untidy bedroom straight when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
his mother, opening her eyes and turning a little on the
bed, said, in a low, tired voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want Bill. Wheer&#8217;s Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent &#8217;im out, dearie; &#8217;e&#8217;ll be back d&#8217;rectly. Don&#8217;t
you worry yourself about Bill. Why, that drattid lamp&#8217;s
a-shinin&#8217; strite onto your eyes. I&#8217;ll turn it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause, while the vehement woman&mdash;quiet
enough now&mdash;arranged the lamp and took her place
by the bedside. She smoothed the young mother&#8217;s faded
hair with one hand. &#8220;Go to sleep, dearie,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Then she began to sing in a hushed, quavering voice.
It was a favourite hymn, and for devotional purposes she
rarely used more than one vowel-sound&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Urbud wuth me! Fust fulls thur uvvun-tud.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GIRL AND THE BEETLE.<br />


<small><i>A STORY OF HERE AND HEREAFTER.</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the brushwood and groups of trees that here and
there broke the monotony of the flat and sandy
common were the marks of autumn. The wind was soft
and mild, and the leaves fell gently, and the white clouds
sailed away into the distance steadily and unquestioningly.
Far off the glint of sunlight fell on the narrow, sluggish
river. Winds and leaves, clouds and river&mdash;all were going
home, with a calm meekness that aggravated the dying
beetle. It was a good day to die on, and the beetle knew
it; but yet he was dissatisfied.</p>

<p>Above him there hovered two unkempt birds, tormented
by a sense of what in all the circumstances was the
correct thing to do. Each bird had sighted the beetle,
and neither would come and take it; for each thought that
the other would suppose him to be greedy. Of these two
birds the one was magnanimous and the other was nervous,
and both were hungry.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a large beetle down there,&#8221; the first remarked,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t know that I care about it particularly. Won&#8217;t
you take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was nothing that his companion would have liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
better, but his unfortunate nervousness prevented him from
availing himself of the generous offer. &#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; he
stammered, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t deprive you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I really don&#8217;t want it,&#8221; said Magnanimity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor do I,&#8221; replied Nervousness. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go for a little
fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they flew slowly away, feeling empty and mistaken,
with a sense that the world must be out of joint where
there were nearly always two birds to one beetle, and both
the birds understood etiquette. And the beetle went on
dying.</p>

<p>He had not during his previous life been a good beetle.
He was strongly built, and his constitution, which had now
given way, had always been considered robust. Female
beetles had thought him uncommonly handsome; yet with
all these gifts he had not been a good beetle; on the
contrary he had been extremely immoral. He lay stretched
on the sand by the edge of the pathway, enjoying the
warmth of the afternoon sunlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; he called, a little querulously, &#8220;come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand how the beetle could call
without making any noise. It should be remembered,
however, that sound is to beetles very much what silence
is to us. A certain kind of silence, on the other hand,
answers to what we call conversation, and can be varied
so as to express all that we can do by changing the tone
of the voice. The small female of depressed appearance,
who hurried from the shelter of a stone in answer to this
summons, quite understood that she had been called
querulously. The two unkempt birds should undoubtedly
have waited.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>&#8220;Thomas,&#8221; said the beetle who had been addressed as
Mary, &#8220;I think you called me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you stopped crying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear; I won&#8217;t cry any more, if you don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t like it. Have you got any new
ideas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Thomas, nothing that could be absolutely called
new, perhaps; but I remember a little story that my poor
dear mother used to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; said Thomas, &#8220;you&#8217;re a stale, heavy-minded
female, and you can get back under the stone. I was going
to let you see me die. I shan&#8217;t now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do let me stop!&#8221; pleaded Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t!&mdash;stay, what&#8217;s that pestilential insect creeping
towards us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Dear Friend. He looks small and meagre,
but we must not judge from looks, Thomas. Beauty
fades.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thomas surveyed Mary slowly. &#8220;It does,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The Dear Friend was so named from his habit of calling
indiscriminately on other beetles, and excusing himself on
the ground that he wanted to be their dear friend. He
lived a very good life, and he wanted other beetles to be
good. The want was noble, but he had not sufficient tact
to conceal it. Some beetles thought him a bore, and did
not care to hear him discuss their sins in his plain way.
Others, seeing that he knew so little about this life, thought
that he might have unusual knowledge of the next. Beetles,
as a class, have a tendency towards mysticism. Mary had
a firm belief in the goodness and spirituality of the Dear
Friend, although she was dimly conscious that he was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
clever. She was very anxious that he should have a few
words with the dying Thomas.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see him, dear, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re
drawing near to your end, you know, and it would do you
good to experience a word in season. You have been such
a bad beetle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Thomas, with a chuckle of intense self-satisfaction,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a devilish bad beetle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thought of his own exceeding immorality seemed
quite to have restored his good temper. &#8220;Heavy-minded
female, you are become brilliant. Never before have I
experienced a word in season. You may stop, and we&#8217;ll
interview the Dear Friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary, like some females of higher organisations, was
rarely able to understand the precise value of a satirical
silence. Everything was cloudy in her brain, and nothing
precise. She had vague ideas that she ought to be good,
and that served her for aspirations. She had at least three
decided opinions&mdash;that her mother had been very good and
very kind to her, that Thomas was horribly bad and very
unkind to her, and that of the two she infinitely preferred
Thomas. She was emotional and rather self-seeking. At
present she was very pleased at being praised, and welcomed
the little visitor kindly as he crept across towards them.
They formed an extraordinary trio even for beetles. It is
not generally known that the lower the physical organisation
the more complicated is the character. A beetle is as a
rule much more contrary and difficult than a man. The
character of a tubercular bacillus is so complex as to
absolutely defy analysis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thomas,&#8221; the Dear Friend began solemnly, &#8220;I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
pleased to see you&mdash;in fact, I have come a long way with
that intention. I had heard that you were very ill and like
to die, and I had also heard&mdash;you will excuse me&mdash;of your
past life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; said Thomas encouragingly, &#8220;I am guilty
of having had a past life. Oh, sir, you can&#8217;t think how
many beetles of my age have had a past of some kind or
other. It is true that it was my own life&mdash;I have not taken
any one else&#8217;s, not yet&mdash;but still I&#8217;ve had it. I feel that
deeply.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the Dear Friend warmed to his work, but made
a fatal mistake&mdash;he grew slightly enthusiastic. Now Thomas
could stand no manner of enthusiasm, because it always
seemed to him to show an exaggerated conception of the
value of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Thomas, I am so very glad to hear you talk
like that. This is indeed no time for idle compliments,
and you recognise the fact. You have the sense of guilt.
You see how disgusting, and loathsome, and abominable
the whole of your life has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by a curious stridulating noise
which Thomas made, thereby rendering it impossible to
catch the remainder of the Dear Friend&#8217;s silence. The
poor little insect cooled down again at once. He saw that
enthusiasm would not do; that he had been taking matters
too fast, and that Thomas was a beetle who required to be
treated with a good deal of tact. The Dear Friend himself
was unable to stridulate, and had sometimes felt the want
of it; but it is not a gift which belongs to every kind of
beetle. Perhaps it would be as well to show some interest
in the process, and then gradually to lead up to more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
serious subjects. He waited till the last whir had died
away, and then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I inquire how you make that noise? It is most
interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thomas knew all about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is caused,&#8221; he answered drily, &#8220;by the friction of a
transversely striated elevation on the posterior border of the
hinder coxa against the hinder margin of the acetabulum,
into which it fits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; gasped the Dear Friend; but he speedily recovered
himself. &#8220;That is indeed interesting&mdash;really,
extremely interesting.&#8221; He was trying to think in what
way it would be possible to connect this with more
important matters. &#8220;Talking about fits,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
have just come away from such a sad case, quite a
young&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not talking about fits, sir,&#8221; interrupted Thomas,
a little irritably. The Dear Friend hastened to agree with
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Thomas, you were not. I see what you mean,
and it&#8217;s very good of you to correct me. I was wrong. I
was quite wrong. But you happened to use the word fits,
and that suggests&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And talking about jests,&#8221; retorted Thomas severely, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think this is the time for them. When you&#8217;re calmer,
my friend, and have got over your inclination to make sport
of serious subjects, you will see this. Please don&#8217;t get excited;
I&#8217;m not equal to it. You come to see me on my
death-bed, and when I try to talk about my past life, you
wax ribald, and begin to make puns that a school-girl would
be ashamed of. I&#8217;m sorry for you, sir,&mdash;very sorry. Mary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
show that bug out. I want to think of my latter end, and
he interrupts me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, dear!&#8221; said the poor, well-meaning little
insect, almost whimpering, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve made a very
bad beginning. I didn&#8217;t intend to offend you, and I do
hope you&#8217;ll make allowances. I know I&#8217;m not very clever,
and I&#8217;m very young, and I&#8217;ve never had any education to
speak of, because I&#8217;ve always been going about in my
humble way trying to teach others. But I do want to
be your really dear friend, and my heart does yearn
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; said the exasperated Thomas, &#8220;I asked you to
show that bug out. Will you kindly go away, sir, and
drown yourself? I insist upon thinking of my latter end,
and I simply cannot do it when you are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go away, if you wish it, Mr. Thomas, but you will
let me come back this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be able to come back, if you drown
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to drown myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you said you were, and you ought to, any way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Thomas, I never, never&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t contradict. It&#8217;s excessively rude, especially in a
young bug like yourself. You promised to drown yourself,
if I&#8217;d bequeath Mary to you in my will. You can take her
now, if you like, and you may both go away and drown
yourselves. I shall be dead before this evening; and if
I am quite dead, you may come back. Now go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Dear Friend turned slowly and sadly away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to take Mary?&#8221; Thomas called after
him. &#8220;You can if you like. She&#8217;s nearly as fat-headed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
yourself, and you&#8217;d get on splendidly together. Pray take
her. I&#8217;m nearly dead, and I don&#8217;t want her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Dear Friend made no reply. The wretched Mary
was crying again. Thomas had worked himself up to
the climax of fury, and was now lapsing from it into a
series of chuckles. &#8220;Moist one,&#8221; he said, turning to
Mary, &#8220;you don&#8217;t love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I do,&#8221; sobbed Mary. &#8220;I love you ever so
much too well&mdash;but you&#8217;re so cruel&mdash;and you make fun
of a good cause&mdash;and you&#8217;re going to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us,&#8221; said Thomas, drily, &#8220;be categorical. You,
like most other females, say too much at once. Your
remarks must be sifted and answered categorically. Firstly,
you state that you love me. Yet you display a lot of wet,
horrible emotion, in order to hasten my end. Don&#8217;t speak;
you know you did;&mdash;and you asked the Dear Friend to come
and bore me in my last moments; and you refused to sit on
his head, or show him out, or stop him in any way. Consequently
I had to stop him myself. I had to be almost rude
to him. Perhaps you&#8217;d better go after him if you&#8217;re so
fond of him. He&#8217;s only half-way across the path, and
you&#8217;ll be able to catch him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Thomas! I&#8217;m sure I never&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Will</i> you keep quiet? Can&#8217;t you see that I&#8217;m being
categorical? Secondly, you say that I&#8217;m cruel. I am,
and it&#8217;s not my fault. If you and other people were not
so abominably heavy-minded, I should not be cruel. You
provoke me. You needn&#8217;t tell me that you can&#8217;t help
being heavy-minded. I know that, and I never said that
it was your fault; but it certainly isn&#8217;t mine. Nothing that
I know of ever is anybody&#8217;s fault. Thirdly, you said that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
made fun of a good cause. You muddler! I love most
causes, and hate most of their promoters. Most causes are
noble, and most promoters are presumptuous. So far from
making fun of the good cause, I did it the greatest service
by asking the Dear Friend to seek an early death. That
reminds me&mdash;you said that I was going to die. So I am,
if you don&#8217;t mind waiting ten minutes. Why this unseemly
haste?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Mary became all tears and disclaimers.
&#8220;If you do that,&#8221; said Thomas, &#8220;you really will have
to go. I am about to die, and I intend to die my own
way, without any weeping females or dear friends. It&#8217;s
much the same with you that it is with man and the
other lower organisms. The good heart generally goes
with a bad head; and if you have a good head, you
probably&mdash;there, I thought so. Do you see? The Dear
Friend on the further side of the path has just been trodden
on by a passing labourer. If he&#8217;d had a little more head,
he would have kept out of the way, and then he would not
have died. Intellect is practical: spirituality is not. Now
that is very curious, for although I have always been a
most practical beetle, I have frequently had strong spiritual
desires. For instance, I often after supper yearn to leave
this gross and uncomely world, and bask in an impossible
hereafter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried Mary. (She liked the ring of his last
sentence.) &#8220;Those are beautiful words. If only you would
always talk like that, instead of insulting those who only
come to do you good. I know the Dear Friend made you
angry; but then it&#8217;s not so much what he said as what he
wanted to say that we must think of.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>&#8220;Ah, yes, my dear Mary, most moist and muddle-headed,
and it is not so much what I am as what I want to be that
the deceased bug should have considered. You were
born with a wrong head, and so you form wrong judgments.
It&#8217;s not your fault; nothing&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s fault. The Dear
Friend was good, but it doesn&#8217;t matter. I am bad, and
that doesn&#8217;t matter either. Nothing matters, and I can&#8217;t
understand anything, and I want to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thomas threw himself on his back and kicked petulantly.
Mary entreated him not to give way to temper; however,
he declared that he was doing no such thing: that he was
trying to think very fast, and that the action of kicking
made it possible to think faster. Suddenly he stopped, and
recovered his normal position. &#8220;Mary,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is
clear to me, and I will make it clear to you, that nothing
matters. Suppose something had an optical delusion, and
the optical delusion died, and had a ghost&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it couldn&#8217;t, Thomas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that. I am only asking you to suppose it&mdash;and
the ghost went to sleep, and dreamed that he was dreaming,
that he was dreaming&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t go on! you&#8217;ll only make your poor head ache!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the something would care very much
what happened in its optical delusion&#8217;s ghost&#8217;s dream&#8217;s
dream&#8217;s dream? Yet the innermost of the three dreams
would seem to be perfectly real, and the apparent reality
would be due to part of the previous experience of the
something, which would be filtered&mdash;or, rather, reflected&mdash;through
the whole series.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do. Please don&#8217;t go on. I don&#8217;t understand
a word of it, and it&#8217;s no use. Oh, <i>do</i> let us talk good.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;You are going to understand it, fat-headed one. You
think that you exist; that everything is real. How do
you know that it is so? When you dream, you imagine
that the dream is quite real; but you wake up and find that
you are wrong. Now suppose the something one day had
a thought, that went through a million optical delusions, a
billion ghosts, and a trillion dreams&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a bit of good,&#8221; interpolated Mary. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
imagine numbers like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That thought might ultimately take the form of this
world, of which I, Thomas, the beetle, am a considerable
part. There is nothing impossible about that. It may be
so, and I am inclined to think that it is so, because something
inside me seems to be struggling to get back to its
origin. But if it is so it must be perfectly clear to you that
nothing matters, because nothing is real, and nothing will
be real till it gets back again to the&mdash;the something!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; said Mary; &#8220;are you quite sure
that it doesn&#8217;t confuse you at all to think that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely sure,&#8221; said Thomas, which was untrue.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you get back again to the something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Thomas drily, &#8220;I will show you in a few
minutes if, as I said before, you do not mind waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a short time neither of them spoke. The sun, like
the spoiled child who promises to be so good if you will
only let him stop, was growing more beautiful than ever as
the time drew near for his departure. He had nothing but
vapour and light with which to work, and yet he produced
some very pretty effects. The gravel path, near which
Thomas and Mary were lying, led into the road which
skirted the edge of the common; along this road was a line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of detached villas. The sun did the best that he could
with them, but felt that he could not do much. The last
house in the line was much larger than the rest, and stood
in much larger grounds. The advertisement had described
them as being park-like, and they certainly contained quite
enough trees almost to hide the house from the views of
those who passed on the road. The sun had found out one
of the windows through the foliage and was making it blaze.
He liked doing that. He could see a good deal of the
house and grounds; in point of height he had the advantage
of passers-by. He could see two tennis-courts, the players,
groups who had gathered to look on, others who strayed
aimlessly about and tried to prove they were not suburban.
It was all cup and conversation, and it rather bored the sun,
who has a masculine mind. None of the people in that
garden were aware that rather less than half a mile from the
house a remarkably fine beetle was dying in his sins; if they
had known it, they might possibly not have cared.</p>

<p>When Thomas began to talk again, he appeared to be
continuing a line of thought of which he had not considered
it worth while to give the beginning.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the truth of the matter is that a beetle did once get
there&mdash;right up beyond the stars, but he never carried a man
there. Aristophanes said he did, but that was an &aelig;tiological
myth. He made up the story to account for a
prevalent belief that man could rise to higher things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was what the Dear Friend always said,&#8221; murmured
Mary reflectively. &#8220;Cows, and pigs, and men, and fowls
can never get up there&mdash;only beetles. It&#8217;s all kept for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not what I say,&#8221; retorted Thomas sharply. &#8220;I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
got better things to do in my last moments than to waste
them in agreeing with anybody. The mistake the man
made was not in supposing that he could rise. All beasts
can rise, as much as we can. His mistake was in rejecting
the supernatural, and thinking that he could be raised only
by a beetle. We may have more spirituality than men.
That is quite possible: they are a lower organism. We may
perhaps find it easier to soar than they do. But I am sure
that all are going there, just as we are, beyond the stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be true,&#8221; said Mary, plucking up a little
spirit; &#8220;but it certainly was not the opinion of the Dear
Friend. Only beetles can rise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you prefer the opinions of the Dear Friend to absolute
truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Mary proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, blind and fat of temperament!&#8221; [This does not
read quite right, but it is a fairly literal translation. There
are no polite English words that exactly express the silence
which Thomas used on this occasion.] &#8220;A few days ago
I was down in the grass by the river. It looks sweet and
green from here. It grows long, and it makes a pleasant
shade above one; but at the roots it&#8217;s all mud and muck.
That is the way of the world; instead of grumbling at the
mud we might just as well be thankful for the grass; however,
that&#8217;s not my point. The cows came down to drink
while I was there. They are nasty, lumpy animals; you
can see their slobbering mouths and great yellow teeth as
they bend over one to crop the grass. Some beetles get
nervous, but I don&#8217;t fancy there&#8217;s any danger. As one of
those brutes stooped down, I looked up and saw right into
its eyes. It was like looking into immeasurable distance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
They were sad, humble, trustful eyes; but there was something
in them which signified the consciousness of a purpose
in being. That is my point. A poor devil of a cow! it
couldn&#8217;t have told any one why it existed, it could not even
have put the reason clearly in its own mind; but it <i>knew</i>.
I am much like the beast. I know, but I cannot say, not
even to myself, the reason for my existence. Sometimes I
think that if all sounds were in my power, I could get the
whole thing out in music. It is a thing which defies ordinary
processes and all logical connexion. I see the fading sunlight
writing something on the under edge of a cloud; the
intellectual part of me cannot read that language, but something
else in me reads it, and understands it, and answers
it almost piteously. &#8216;Oh that I might fly away and be at
rest!&#8217; And suddenly the conviction is strong in me that
I know why I am here, and what I shall be hereafter. In
the awful silence of the night that conviction comes dropping
down my dark mind like a falling star. In moments of
acute dyspepsia I always feel it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grinned pleasantly. He had spoiled his own poetry,
and that pleased him. In his former life he had always
been trying to make pretty things, and had always broken
them up again. The grin passed from him, and he
continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cows, therefore, have souls. You needn&#8217;t contradict
me, and thrust that omniscient Dear Friend down my
throat, because I won&#8217;t stand it. I tell you that I saw
into their eyes, and I know. If you want to get at the
bottom of things, you must leave all ordinary processes, all
logical processes. You can&#8217;t crawl down that way: you
must jump. The people who dare not jump see that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
have got to the bottom of things, and comfort themselves
with saying that you must have hurt your poor head terribly.
Have I hurt my head, Mary? For my intellect is all gone,
and the light is fading very quickly. You hate men, I
think. Never despise them any more; for they have souls.
They cut down the grass, and it dies. They pull the flowers,
and they die. They tread on the beetles, and they die.
They kill the animals, cut down the trees, and poison the
rivers. Where a man comes, death always follows. They
are murderers; they are hideously ugly; they make unpleasant
noises, and do not understand silences; they are
the very lowest of all creatures, but they are on their way
to a hereafter. Nothing&#8217;s wasted: the very strictest economy
is practised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand you, Thomas; and I am afraid that
you are getting worse. It tries you to talk. Why did you
say the light was fading? The sun is still shining all over
us. Oh, Thomas, you&#8217;ll be gone soon&mdash;may I cry now?
I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thomas did not seem to have heard her. &#8220;I have been
wicked, and yet not I,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was something bad in
me that will pass. And the world did provoke me terribly;
it would be so emotional and stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary was crying unreservedly, but Thomas did not notice it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something,&#8221; he said, &#8220;has come into my head which
wants thinking out, but I will not bother myself. I have
the easier way. Good-bye&mdash;for the sake of old times&mdash;Mary,
darling. I am going to know everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he curled up his legs quietly, and died.</p>

<p>Mary stopped crying, and examined the body. Yes, he
was quite dead. Then she started away on a journey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Thomas had been a wicked beetle, and he had talked
wrongly in his last moments, and she was afraid to be near
his body. Besides, she had heard of a vacancy.</p>

<p>The sun had quite finished with the window of that villa
now, and the park-like grounds were nearly empty. On one
of the courts a few enthusiasts were still playing, and would
continue to play until they went in to dress. Out through
the gate a young man sauntered into the road. The look of
an escaped animal was on his face. He had been talking to
a number of people whom he neither knew nor wanted to
know. He had seen nothing of Marjorie, his host&#8217;s daughter,
a child who always pleased and generally amused him. He
felt that he had done much for his hostess; he had suffered
privations. And now he was glad that the bulk of the
visitors&mdash;all who were not staying in the house&mdash;had gone.
He took the path across the common, pausing to light a
pipe with a wax match and an air of relief. He walked in
the direction of the spot where the dead body of Thomas
was lying.</p>

<p>One of the two unkempt birds came slowly flying back
again. It was he to whom the surname of Magnanimity
has been given. He had got rid of his companion by some
pretext of an appointment, and he had come back again to
look for that beetle. He swooped down close beside the
dead body of the insect, and turned it over with his beak.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just my luck,&#8221; he murmured softly. &#8220;I never
could stand cold meat.&#8221; But that was affectation.</p>

<p>At this moment a small stone struck the ground within
a foot of where the unkempt bird was standing. He hopped
away in an aggrieved fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t fly away yet,&#8221; he said sulkily, &#8220;it would only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
make the man conceited. They&#8217;re always chucking stones,
these fools of men, and they hardly ever hit anything.
They like to think that we&#8217;re afraid of them, and I&#8217;m not
the least bit afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another stone missed by a sixteenth of an inch the
bird&#8217;s tail-feathers, and Magnanimity with one scream of
bad language flew upwards. When he got there, he found
that his nervous and unkempt companion had come back
again, and had been watching him all the time. Then the
magnanimous fowl swore worse than ever. There was no
doubt that the nervous one would have a pretty story to
tell about that pretended appointment.</p>

<p>The young man, who had thrown the stones, sauntered
slowly up and surveyed the dead beetle, taking it in his
hand to examine it more closely. He knew something
about beetles&mdash;he had collected them in his school-days&mdash;and
he saw that this was a large one of its kind, a fine
specimen. He slipped it into one of his coat pockets, and
strolled slowly back again to the house. He had originally
meant to go further, but he had changed his intention. He
was comparing in his own mind his favourite Marjorie, a
child not quite fifteen, with the finished and ordinary girl
as turned out in large numbers for the purposes of suburban
tennis. He was also wondering casually why there were
any beetles in the world, and why he had once been so
interested in them.</p>

<p>When he got back to the house he paused in the hall for
a second, and then went slowly upstairs to a room at the
top of the house, used as a schoolroom by Marjorie and her
governess, Miss Dean.</p>

<p>Marjorie was seated at the table writing. She had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
large French dictionary by her side. She was dressed in
dark blue serge. Her long hair had become a little untidy
in her struggle to be idiomatic. She had a pale, intelligent
face. She looked up as the young man entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully glad you&#8217;ve come,&#8221; she said, smiling. &#8220;It
was getting rather dull, being all alone. Did you have
some good setts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not particularly&mdash;didn&#8217;t play much. I talked, and
made myself useful, and ate ices, and drank things most of
the time. You can&#8217;t see like that.&#8221; He struck a match,
and lit the gas, and then he seated himself at the piano.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Miss Dean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she went away as usual at half-past five, and left
me this stuff to do for to-morrow. I&#8217;m doing it now,
because I am going to be down in the drawing-room to-night.
Only three more days to the holidays!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got any tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie nodded her head towards a table at the side of
the room. &#8220;They brought it up about an hour ago,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite cold&mdash;will you ring for some more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; he answered, as he got up and helped
himself. &#8220;This will do very well. I am not really thirsty,
because, as I said, I have been drinking during the whole
of the afternoon&mdash;more or less. But I never feel absolutely
sociable unless I am either smoking or drinking. Have
you got much more to do for the estimable one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, only a few words. It was a shorter bit than
usual, and I expected to have got it finished ever so long
ago. But when it came to doing it, there were a lot of
words that I&#8217;d never seen before. I know the French for
a plate, or a glass, or a horse, or a hat, or anything like that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
But I always have to look up words like buttercup or gridiron.
Now here&#8217;s a word of that kind. What&#8217;s the French
for beetle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Escarbot, I believe, but I wouldn&#8217;t swear to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Maurice,&#8221; Marjorie said very earnestly,
leaning her pretty little chin on one hand, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you
what I&#8217;ve noticed. When a thing&#8217;s different in one way,
it&#8217;s always different in another. If a piece for translation
is extra short, there are always more words to look up. If
I have an awfully bad morning, and Miss Dean is savage,
and Aunt Julia patronises me, and Miss Matthieson makes
me kiss her&mdash;bah!&mdash;I&#8217;m always glad at the end of it,
because I know I am going to have a specially good afternoon
or evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjorie, I believe you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;ll have a bad
morning to-morrow if that wretched piece about the gridirons
and beetles isn&#8217;t done for the inestimable Dean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll finish in less than two minutes. Play something
while I&#8217;m doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the piano and took down the first piece that
came. It was a drawing-room piece, and had the entire
absence of soul which always appealed to the corresponding
vacuum in the chilly Miss Dean. It was moderately
difficult, and sounded <i>very</i> difficult. Miss Dean well knew
that when a girl like Marjorie, not yet fifteen, played that
piece properly, it would be acknowledged to reflect great
credit on her teacher. Maurice Grey opened the piece,
looked at it suspiciously, skipped the introduction, played
a few bars from the first page, glanced at the fifth page,
then shut it up, and put it back again on the top of the
piano with a sigh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;I hate that too,&#8221; said Marjorie. &#8220;Play the thing you
played to them last night in the drawing-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t in the drawing-room last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but my bedroom&#8217;s just above, and I could hear it.
It went like this.&#8221; She hummed a few bars.</p>

<p>Maurice began to play once more. It was a mischievous,
tender, eccentric little dance that went laughing about the
piano as if it were mad. Marjorie had finished her work,
and rose from the table and stood beside him, watching
him with dark, attentive eyes as he played. She was thinking
that she liked Maurice. He knew the right way to treat
her. Aunt Julia treated her like a baby, and other visitors
often appeared to be under the impression that children
like inanity. Her father was rather an apathetic man, yet
he had the sincerest affection for his wife, his only daughter,
and young Maurice Grey. He had many acquaintances,
but no other friends. He had been &#8220;Meyner and Sons,&#8221;
who did great things in iron, but he disposed of his business
to a company soon after his marriage. He was absorbed in
the study of psychology, and made many curious experiments
upon himself. In one or two of these young Maurice had
been of some service to him. But in his family affections,
his studies, or his experiments, he showed very little enthusiasm.
He never expected to get great results. &#8220;The
evidence is so bad,&#8221; he said to Maurice once, speaking of
his favourite pursuit. &#8220;On my subject men lie often
intentionally; and often deceive themselves and lie unintentionally,
and rarely speak the truth. Also I find
out more and more that I cannot even trust my own
senses. The human brain is a shockingly defective
instrument.&#8221; He was a little sensitive, and to visitors in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
his house&mdash;with the exception of Maurice&mdash;he would talk
of anything but psychology. Psychology, he found, was
a thing they never understood at all, and at which they
generally laughed. Marjorie&#8217;s mother, Mrs. Meyner, was
not so apathetic or so pessimistic, but then her horizon
was not extended. The circle of her friends and relations
gave her enough to think about and to make life worth
living. She was a very gentle, unselfish woman, and had
a provoking knack of sincerely liking nearly everybody.
Her half-sister, Julia, had the opposite knack of hating
nearly everybody. Julia was old and unmarried, and had
a wonderful tongue; she dressed perfectly, had snowy hair,
a kind face, a sweet smile, gentle ways, and a perfectly
venomous disposition. Marjorie did not like her Aunt
Julia. She did not like Miss Matthieson much better&mdash;a
sentimental woman. Miss Dean was too chilly a person
to like exactly; Marjorie respected her sometimes. But
she did like Maurice, and she liked the music that he was
playing now.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is awfully nice,&#8221; she said, when the piece was
finished. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie&#8217;s aunt Julia had asked the same question of
him the night before in the drawing-room, and he had told
her that the piece was by Grieg, which was untrue, and
which he knew to be untrue. He was not aware that that
cheerful, spiteful, and horribly intellectual old lady also
knew that he was lying. He had felt it better to blaspheme
the name of Grieg than to give her a chance by owning
that he had composed the thing himself. He was a young
man of dangerously diverse talents. He was just at the
end of his first year at Cambridge, and was reading for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Classical Tripos. Now the Classical Tripos is a jealous
mistress, and admits of no rivals. Nevertheless, he had
become a very fair oar, was socially popular, and had
devoted much time to psychology and more to music. The
end of such a course is generally failure. He did not mind
telling Marjorie about the little dance he had just been
playing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have a general impression that it is
mine; but there&#8217;s a touch of Grieg about it. In fact, I
risked telling your aunt Julia last night that it was Grieg&#8217;s.
I daren&#8217;t tell her it was mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Marjorie sadly, &#8220;she is awful. She pats me
gently on the head, and tells me I&#8217;m a good little child, and
that I may run away to the nursery and play. It&#8217;s perfectly
maddening. She knows as well as I do that I&#8217;m nearly
fifteen, and that it&#8217;s absolute nonsense to talk like that.
She does it on purpose to make me angry, and I hate being
angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice took a long sip at his cold tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the people in this world want sorting.
Have you finished your piece about the beetle and the
gridirons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! There&#8217;s nothing in it really about gridirons,
but a beetle comes into it&mdash;a dead beetle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; said Maurice suddenly, thrusting his hand
into his pocket, &#8220;that reminds me!&#8221; He pulled out the
dead body of Thomas, and laid it carefully on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what do you think of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly horrible,&#8221; said Marjorie. &#8220;Where did you
get it? What did you do it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I strolled on to the common after tennis for a smoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
and I happened to find it. I used to collect these things
when I was at school. I suppose I picked it up from force
of habit, but I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know. You ought not to
call it horrible, you know. It&#8217;s really a fine specimen of its
kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie looked at it more closely, turning it over with
the end of a penholder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember saying just now,&#8221; said Maurice, &#8220;that
things which were different in one way were generally
different in another? Beetles are different from us; they
can&#8217;t do the same things; we despise them; they haven&#8217;t
as good a time. Perhaps they can do things we don&#8217;t know
anything about; perhaps they despise us; perhaps they are
going to have a better time in some other world. What
are all the stars for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie wrinkled her brows, and kicked one tiny slipper
half off.</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost think I see what you mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not at all sure I meant anything,&#8221; said Maurice.
&#8220;It was just a suggestion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie had thrown down the penholder, and taken the
body of Thomas in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beetles might have some secrets that we know nothing
about. But Miss Dean says that all insects were sent into
the world for the birds to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice was silent for a moment. He was remembering
that Miss Dean had remarked to him the day before that
she considered that the birds had been created to kill the
insects. &#8220;I should like to talk the question over with a
beetle. Now I must be off and dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had gone an old trick of Marjorie&#8217;s younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
days came back to her. She had often, in her babyhood,
held conversations with voiceless or inarticulate things, such
as dolls or cats, and on one occasion, after a stormy music
lesson, she had made the piano promise to <i>make</i> the music
come out right next time. She had always to do the
speaking for them, so it was not quite convincing; but it
was helpful and consolatory in its way. And now she began
to talk to the beetle aloud, holding it on the palm of one
little white hand&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beetle, tell me your secrets. Tell me all your secrets.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know if beetles are as good as men. Are
they? Are they better than men? Are there better things
than we ever think of doing, which we might do if it was
only possible to think of them? <i>Do</i> tell me. I won&#8217;t tell
anybody, except Maurice and mamma, if she asks me, but
she won&#8217;t. You <i>might</i> tell me&mdash;it&#8217;s quite safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was only silence; but then it has been proved
already that silence is a beetle&#8217;s method of speech. Perhaps
the spirit of Thomas was there and answered her; perhaps
it was elsewhere; perhaps Thomas never had a spirit.</p>

<p>Marjorie put the beetle down again on the table, with a
laugh at herself for her silliness.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room that night, she saw very little of
Maurice. Aunt Julia looked as perfect and sweet and
gentle an old lady as ever; and her conversation was just
as poisonous as usual. Her temper must even have been a
little worse than normal. She commenced to talk about
psychology with Mr. Meyner, because she knew that he
hated discussing it with the uninitiated. She insisted that
he was joking&mdash;the poor man never joked; he was half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
earnestness and half apathy&mdash;and she told him untrue
stories. When he escaped, she fastened on to Miss
Matthieson, who was a sentimental and ignorant woman,
with a desire to love art. She invented an entirely fictitious
picture of Turner, described it, and gave its precise position
in the National Gallery; she finally made Miss Matthieson
talk about it, become enraptured about it, and confess what
her sensations were when she first saw it. She did not
enlighten her; that would have been too crude an enjoyment
for Aunt Julia. Her smile became just a little
sweeter, and she assured Miss Matthieson that she had
learned much from her. Maurice Grey had, for reasons of
his own, been playing Chopin&#8217;s Funeral March. &#8220;And is
that also by Grieg?&#8221; she asked him, looking interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is not,&#8221; he said shortly. He knew very well that
Aunt Julia knew very well what he had been playing; and
he saw what she meant by her question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t be angry with me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
no musician, you know, Mr. Grey,&#8221;&mdash;her knowledge of
music was, as Maurice was aware, considerably above the
average&mdash;&#8220;and I make stupid mistakes. Last night you
played a little dance which you told me was by Grieg.
Now, I never should have known it; I thought it was
pretty enough, but just a little weak and&mdash;well, almost
amateurish, you know. You played it again in the schoolroom
this afternoon, and you altered the last part of it.
What <i>is</i> that thing you played just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chopin&#8217;s Funeral March.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to make any&mdash;any improvements in it,
as you did in the Grieg? And why did you play a funeral
march? I suppose the sight of an old woman like myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
among so many young people, suggested the thought of
death. Ah, yes&mdash;very natural.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was absolutely intolerable, but Maurice was not
allowed to protest or escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great mistake,&#8221; said Aunt Julia, earnestly, &#8220;to
give one&#8217;s self up to trivialities. We must all die. It is
always better to think about death, even in the drawing-room
after dinner. I mean that it&#8217;s better for the aged,
like myself. To the young it might perhaps seem a little
gloomy and morbid, but I like it&mdash;I enjoy it. I shall be
going to bed directly. Won&#8217;t you play a few hymn tunes,
Mr. Grey, before I go? You might play the Dies Ir&aelig;.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not go to bed until she had maddened about
half the people in the room. Even Mrs. Meyner found it
difficult at times to make excuses for Aunt Julia. Maurice
Grey managed to be moderately polite to her as a rule; he
generally shammed stupidity, and refused to see the point
of any of her sarcasms. He found afterwards that this
style of treatment had impressed Miss Julia Stone. When
Marjorie came round to say good-night to Maurice, she
spoke to him about the beetle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want that dead beetle?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Shall I
keep it for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going on collecting again then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so&mdash;but it is too good a specimen to
throw away just anywhere. How would you like to be
thrown away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not quite the same thing, you know, Maurice. I&#8217;m
more important. But we&#8217;ll treat this beetle very well&mdash;you&#8217;ve
just played a funeral march for it&mdash;and then, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
its ghost will come and tell us all about beetles, and
what beetles think about men, and if they know anything
that we don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, treat it kindly,&#8221; said Maurice, smiling. &#8220;Much
can always be done by kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie went out of the room laughing; but on the
following morning, when she appeared at breakfast, she
was very quiet and subdued. A note came from Miss
Dean, regretting that&mdash;&#8220;owing to a slight indisposition&#8221;&mdash;she
was unable to come to teach Marjorie that morning.
Even the prospect of a day&#8217;s holiday did not seem to cheer
her up. Maurice found her alone in the garden about an
hour afterwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, Marjorie?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m always well&mdash;I&#8217;ve got something to tell
you though. I saw it last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The beetle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice was a little startled. He too had had a curious
dream in which the beetle had figured. &#8220;Look here,
Marjorie,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing particular to do this
morning, and I believe you&#8217;d be the better for a walk.
We&#8217;ll go over to Weyford, and then go up to St. Margaret&#8217;s,
if you don&#8217;t mind climbing the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that would be lovely! That&#8217;s just the thing. We
shan&#8217;t get back to lunch, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;ll lunch in Weyford. I&#8217;ll go in
and talk to Mrs. Meyner about it, and you go and get
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>The morning sunlight and the cool wind made walking
pleasant. That unkempt bird, whom we have called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Magnanimity, was taking out quite a young bird for a
little exercise. They saw Maurice and Marjorie walking
together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are men,&#8221; said the young bird. &#8220;Bless your
heart&mdash;I&#8217;ve seen lots of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just drop that,&#8221; said Magnanimity, sternly. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing more sickening than to hear a mere chick like
yourself setting up to be a complete bird of the world.
Fancy taking any notice of contemptible, ugly men!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That young she-man,&#8221; said the mere chick, &#8220;isn&#8217;t at all
ugly. I often wish I were a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d soon wish you were a bird again,&#8221; retorted
Magnanimity. &#8220;Are you aware that men can&#8217;t fly, or lay
eggs, or talk our language, or do anything really worth
doing? Are you aware that we old birds lead them the
very devil of a life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do it?&#8221; asked the mere chick, quite
unable to keep the wonder and admiration out of the tone
of its voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we mock at &#8217;em&mdash;sneer at &#8217;em till they can&#8217;t bear
themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie and Maurice walked on, talking of indifferent
things. They climbed the hill, resting occasionally in the
shade of the plantations that grew on its sides. They
reached the summit at last, a solitary place where the ruined
chapel of St. Margaret stood in a little deserted grave-yard.
The wind was fresh and cool. They could see far away
into the distance; they could see the river winding along
down the valley, until it was a mere thread of silver; they
could see the smoke curling up from low, red-roofed
cottages and farm-buildings, scattered here and there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
Maurice stretched himself at full length on the grass, and
endeavoured to light a cigarette. There was just enough
wind to blow a match out. There always is.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, Marjorie, you had a dream last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it frightened you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no&mdash;well, it didn&#8217;t exactly frighten me&mdash;it made
me think. It was all nonsense, you know, and yet it was
the realest dream I ever had in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop a minute. You had some coffee in the drawing-room,
and that kept you awake for a long time, you turned
about from side to side, and thought about the beetle.
Your bedroom seemed hot and stifling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all true&mdash;how did you know, Maurice?&mdash;but
it has not got anything to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjorie, if you&#8217;d never had that coffee, you&#8217;d have
never had that dream. Now, then, let&#8217;s hear it. I&#8217;ll try
to keep awake, but walking always makes me sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After I had said good-night to everybody, I went up
into the schoolroom and got the beetle, because I was
afraid the servants might throw it away in the morning, and
you said you wanted it. I took it into my own room, and
put it down on a table. All the while I was undressing, I
kept thinking about it and wondering if beetles and other
things could really understand, or if it were only men and
women who knew about things, and if all the world were
just made for us alone. Before I got into bed I picked
the beetle up, and said to it, &#8216;Beetle, you&#8217;ve got to come
into my dream to-night, and tell me all about it. Don&#8217;t
forget.&#8217; Of course that was just a fancy. I didn&#8217;t really
think it could understand what I said, or that it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
come. I&#8217;m not a baby, though Aunt Julia treats me like
one sometimes. Well, for a long time I couldn&#8217;t get to
sleep, but at last I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then the beetle came and suffocated you, or threw
you over a precipice,&#8221; remarked Maurice, drowsily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not a bit like it. I don&#8217;t know how long I
had been asleep, but I dreamed that I woke up suddenly,
and that the moonlight was streaming in at the window.
Right in the middle of the moonlight was the beetle,
standing up on his hind legs. He had grown ever so much
bigger, and was as tall as I am. &#8216;Come on, now,&#8217; he said.
&#8216;How much longer are you going to keep me waiting?
I&#8217;m late, as it is.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel the least bit afraid of him. I just asked
him where we were going. He opened the window, and
pointed upwards. &#8216;Well,&#8217; I said, &#8216;you must wait till I&#8217;m
dressed, else I shall catch cold.&#8217; However, he wouldn&#8217;t
wait, and so I got out of bed. We climbed up on to the
table in front of the window. &#8216;Now then,&#8217; he said, &#8216;you
must keep hold of my fore-leg, or you&#8217;ll fall.&#8217; We didn&#8217;t
fly or walk; we floated out of the window, and then upwards,
going very quickly and steadily, as if a wind were
blowing us. As we were floating up, the beetle&#8217;s head
changed till it became just like Aunt Julia&#8217;s. &#8216;Marjorie&#8217;s
an unnatural child,&#8217; it said in Aunt Julia&#8217;s voice. &#8216;She
doesn&#8217;t care for dolls&mdash;doesn&#8217;t care for anything except
music and Maurice.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice had an unworthy and needless impression that
the girl was making some of this up. He looked at her
curiously, as though he were going to say something; but
he refrained, and she continued her dream&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t quite know what to say, but I told the beetle
that he was entirely wrong&mdash;that I liked papa and mamma
very much indeed, and rather liked almost everybody.
Then I asked him how he managed to speak, being a
beetle, and how he could hear me speak. He told me that
neither of us had spoken a word: when I contradicted him,
he said that if I had gone back to my own room I should
have found that my real body was still lying asleep in bed.
&#8216;Now,&#8217; he pointed out, &#8216;you can&#8217;t speak without your body&mdash;so
that is proved.&#8217; Then he said that beetles never
spoke, and that as a matter of fact we were not speaking,
but just understanding each other&#8217;s silence. Still, it seemed
just like speaking. We must have moved very quickly,
because by this time we had got quite beyond the moon.
I could see it ever so far beneath my feet, and the stars all
scattered about the darkness; yet I didn&#8217;t remember passing
them on our way up. I didn&#8217;t feel at all cold. As the
beetle went on talking&mdash;it was just like real talking, so it
doesn&#8217;t matter whether it was real or not&mdash;he stopped being
like Aunt Julia. He got his own head back again, and
his own voice&mdash;except that sometimes it began to be rather
like yours. You haven&#8217;t gone to sleep, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice had not gone to sleep, and said so.</p>

<p>&#8220;The strangest thing was that although his body had not
really changed&mdash;except that it was so much bigger&mdash;it
didn&#8217;t seem at all ugly now. In fact, I liked to look at it,
and didn&#8217;t at all mind keeping hold of its fore-leg. I think
the beetle must have known what I was thinking about, for
all of a sudden he said, as if he were sorry for me: &#8216;Poor
Marjorie! Poor little Marjorie! They&#8217;ve taught you all
wrong, and they taught me all wrong. But I had a glimpse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
of the right thing: I always knew that human beings were
not half as ugly as they seemed to be. I said as much, but
it was of no use to talk to the Dear Friend. As for Mary&mdash;that
fat-headed female had believed so many other things
that she had no capacity left for believing any more. I,
however, had got plenty of room left&mdash;oh, yes, plenty of
room.&#8217; When he said that he chuckled in the most
horrible way you ever heard. &#8216;Now I come to think of it,&#8217;
he went on, &#8216;I believe I did <i>say</i> that the human breed
were ugly. It was such a tame thing to believe anything
that one said; it was a thing that Mary always did, and so I
didn&#8217;t. Marjorie, if the good people hadn&#8217;t been good, I
should have liked goodness.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who were Mary and the Dear Friend?&#8221; asked
Maurice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any more than you do. I don&#8217;t think he
liked the Dear Friend very much; sometimes he seemed to
hate Mary, and sometimes he seemed to love her and pity
her. Now do you know what he told me? He said
positively that all beetles believed that they had souls which
never died, and that the sun, and stars, and everything were
made for them alone. They believed that men, and other
animals, had no souls at all. I told him how very absurd
that was, and tried to explain to him what was really the
case; but he only chuckled horribly again. But as we went
up higher and higher he got more grave, and he didn&#8217;t
laugh any more; and once or twice he said to me quite
sadly, &#8216;Poor little Marjorie, you are very young to bother
yourself about these things. You only know part&mdash;only
part&mdash;and I cannot tell you the rest&mdash;I may not!&#8217; I began
to get quite sorry for him, because it seemed to trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
him; I think he really wanted to tell me some more things.
Just then I saw up above us a River of Light. It was
flowing very swiftly and smoothly, and looked like melted
gold. I don&#8217;t know why, but I wanted to plunge into the
River. It seemed to be the only thing worth doing, or that
ever had been worth doing. I never wanted anything so
much before in my life, but the beetle would not let me go.
Last of all I began to cry; I really did, and you know,
Maurice, that I hardly ever cry. But it was of no use; he
still kept tight hold of my hand. The darkness was all grey
darkness, except one black piece which stuck up like a
mountain. We stopped on the top of it, and looked down
at the River. I kept on crying&mdash;I do not know why, but
I think it was because it all seemed strange and awful. I
may have been frightened a little, but it was not quite like
being frightened. There was a long pause, and then the
beetle said, &#8216;Ah, if you only knew now, Marjorie! And if
I had only known then!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just then out of the grey darkness came a thread of
light, like a little snake, moving very quickly and curling
about as if it were glad; it hurried towards the great River
of Light, and melted into it and was gone. I was eager
about it, and asked the beetle what it was. &#8216;I may tell you
that,&#8217; he replied. &#8216;It was a soul going home!&#8217; I stopped
crying then; I felt something the way I feel at an evening
service in a church in summer time, when they are singing
one of the hymns I like best. It was a sort of quiet
happiness; I can&#8217;t explain it properly, but I never felt so
happy as I did then. &#8216;Beetle,&#8217; I said, &#8216;you must tell me
the rest now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will tell you one thing,&#8217;&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;What was it?&#8221; asked Maurice quickly.</p>

<p>For a few seconds Marjorie did not answer. There was
a queer dreamy look in her eyes. At last she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maurice, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll think now that I have been
making all this up, but I haven&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t tell you what the
beetle said, because I <i>don&#8217;t know</i>. It was about you, and
it was very important. I don&#8217;t even know whether it was
good or bad. It has gone straight out of my memory, and
I <i>can&#8217;t</i> get it back again. I&#8217;d give anything to be able to
remember it. I&#8217;ve been thinking about it all the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you entirely,&#8221; said Maurice thoughtfully. &#8220;I
have had much the same kind of thing happen to me in a
dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not add that much the same thing had happened
to him on the same night. &#8220;How did the dream end?&#8221;
he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I awoke directly after the beetle told me that thing that
I have forgotten. It was broad daylight. But when I got
up, the beetle was not on the table where I had put it. I
could not find it anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You probably moved it in your sleep. Did you ever
walk in your sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once, when I was quite little&mdash;almost a baby. I had
got out into the garden, and my nurse found me there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice rose, and the two went down the hill together.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t trouble about all that if I were you,&#8221; said
Maurice. &#8220;These things can generally be explained in the
simplest way when one goes through them carefully. Coffee,
the action of the heart, the position of the body in bed, the
sounds that one hears while asleep, all help to explain a
good deal, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>He did not tell her his own dream. He thought, perhaps
rightly, that a young girl, unacquainted with the study of
mathematics, might be unduly impressed by coincidences
which were unusual but did not require a supernatural
explanation. He did not want to frighten her, or let her
grow superstitious. Yet during the day he thought a good
deal about the two dreams.</p>

<p>He had dreamed that he was seated on the one side of
the fireplace in his rooms at Cambridge, and that the beetle,
with the same exaggerated dimensions with which Marjorie
had seen him, was seated in a lounge chair on the other
side. They were discussing Maurice&#8217;s psychological studies,
and Maurice was describing to him some of the curious
experiments which he had made in conjunction with
Mr. Meyner. Every difficulty that Maurice propounded
the beetle made clear at once. He even suggested fresh
problems which had not occurred to Maurice before, and was
equally ready with their solution. His last words before
Maurice awoke were: &#8220;There are many things besides
which you ought to know, and of which you have not
realised your own ignorance. You will know them all one
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was all that Maurice could remember of his dream.
The difficulties propounded and the explanations given had
passed completely out of his recollection. He was only
conscious that during his dream he had felt an exhilarating
sensation of having known for certain things which he had
thought it impossible that any one, at least in this life, could
know at all.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he returned to Cambridge. By this
time Marjorie seemed to have recovered her normal spirits.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
She made no further allusion to her dream. She was
unaffectedly sorry at the departure of Maurice.</p>

<p>Maurice had not been long at Cambridge before he
received news of the sudden death of Mr. Meyner. Apart
from the friendship he had always felt for Mr. Meyner, the
death seemed to him peculiarly distressing and pathetic.
The man had worked hard at a study which fascinated him,
not from any desire for gain, or fame to be derived from it,
but with the most genuine devotion to the study itself; and
he had died before his work was done, before he had
arrived at any large and definite result. Yet Maurice felt
assured that Meyner&#8217;s patience, and judgment, and freedom
from prejudice, would, if he had but lived longer, have
brought him some reward, some light. He had always
distrusted and undervalued himself; his humility was
genuine, but almost irritating. He had been at school, and
subsequently at college, with Maurice&#8217;s guardian, and had
first met Maurice when he was a boy of fifteen; the friendship
between the boy and the middle-aged man had formed
slowly, but surely, since then; yet, although he gave every
sign of his liking for Maurice, he never seemed to expect
Maurice to like him in return; he certainly never realised
the admiration which Maurice had for his knowledge and
attainments. So too he loved his wife and only child
dearly, and he knew that they loved him; but he had never
realised how much they loved him, and would very possibly
have thought such love almost irrational. To some extent,
perhaps, his studies had spoiled him; he had been groping
in the darkness after great things, and the one result that he
seemed to have found there was a sense of his own insignificance.
Yet, illogically enough, he had never thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
others insignificant; he had never reached the cynical
conclusion that nobody matters very much. If his friends
and his sympathies were so few, it was not because the
outside world did not matter to him, but because he could
not believe that he mattered to the outside world. He had
died without ever having learned his own value.</p>

<p>A parcel which was forwarded to Maurice from Mrs.
Meyner shortly afterwards contained the many note-books
which her husband had filled with the evidence he had
collected, and the work he had done, until death interrupted
him. With them was a simple and pathetic letter that he
had written to Maurice on the day before he died. &#8220;Look
through them,&#8221; the letter said, in reference to the note-books.
&#8220;You will see and understand what I was aiming
at. If you think it worth while, carry on the investigation
which I began; I own that it is some pleasure to me to
think that it is possible that you may do so; that one who
was intimate with my views, and who shared some of my
opinions, which are not generally held, may be able to give
those views and opinions their justification. But I do not
want you to pledge yourself in any way, nor do I ask you to
give up your tripos or your career at college for the purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice paused as he read this last sentence. How
often he had thought, as he turned English verse into
indifferent alcaics, that this classical work could only lead,
was only educative, could never be considered as an end.
But he came to no final decision until he had spent nearly
a month in a rapid survey of those note-books. They
startled him; the minute accuracy and patience shown in the
collection of evidence were only what he expected from such
a man as Meyner, but the brilliant audacity of his theories,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the almost savage independence of an original mind, looked
far different when plainly stated in black and white, than
when they had fallen humbly and almost hesitatingly from
the man&#8217;s own lips. The romantic side in Maurice&#8217;s
character was touched most by what was worst in Meyner&#8217;s
books; the finished and unprejudiced scholar would have
shaken his head over much that looked like vain imagining,
that was extravagant, and, so far, unsupported. Maurice
was younger; Meyner&#8217;s fierce opposition of an accepted
view attracted him, and awoke his pugnacity. He would
linger over page after page of what seemed to him splendid
conjecture, of what might have seemed to others very
useless stuff, and say to himself: &#8220;If only one could prove
that this <i>is</i> so, instead of longing that it <i>may</i> be so!&#8221; The
air of conviction with which Meyner wrote down his own
views on his own subject gained immeasurably in Maurice&#8217;s
eyes from the personal knowledge which Maurice had of
Meyner&#8217;s perpetual tendency to undervalue himself, and to
distrust himself in all other matters. Even with these views
in his mind, he had expected no great results; he had been
too honest to support them with any evidence that was not
thoroughly tested. They seemed to Maurice to be the
guess of genius; the air of conviction had for him the
strange attraction of a religious, not wholly rational, faith.
He decided to abandon his University career, and to
devote his time to a further prosecution of Meyner&#8217;s
investigations.</p>

<p>His guardian, who was also his uncle, made very little
opposition. Maurice had given so much evidence that he
was stable. He had an unusually large allowance for a
young man at Cambridge, and yet he had not run into debt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
At Cambridge the wealthy are the most in debt, because
they have most credit and most temptations. As a matter
of fact, Maurice never had considered the financial side of
anything; it had simply happened that he had never wanted
more than he could well afford. But this weighed very
much in Maurice&#8217;s favour with his guardian. He felt that
his nephew was a man who understood value, and could
be trusted. The property to which Maurice would succeed,
when he came of age, made it unnecessary for him to adopt
any profession; nor did it bring with it any of those special
responsibilities for which a special training is supposed to
be necessary.</p>

<p>Maurice, therefore, spent the next two years abroad,
for the most part in Paris. He had carried with him an
introduction to a physician at one of the Paris hospitals,
who sympathised with him in his work, and was able to be
of great assistance to him. In this man he gained a friend;
in other respects these were years, it seemed to him, of
disillusion. One by one the great, beautiful theories had
to go; a tiny meagre fact would start up, a fact that meant
but little to the ordinary observer, and it would be strong
enough to overthrow years of work, and send the conjecture
on which they were founded to some limbo for lost
absurdities. He had long ago been aghast when he had
tried to realise how vast is the amount of the things that
no man knows. And now for &#8220;knows&#8221; he put &#8220;can
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Meyner and Marjorie had also been abroad, but he
had seen them very seldom in those two years. Marjorie
seemed to be slowly changing; he was no longer the
recipient of childish confidences. She was grave and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
beautiful, perhaps, than she had been; and she was also
more quiet and reserved; she was friendly with him, up to
a limit; she told him news, of a kind; she sympathised with
his disappointments in his work, within decent bounds.
At the end of the second year, when Mrs. Meyner and
Marjorie were staying for a few days in Paris, and Maurice
was at last awakening to the fact that he could not expect
childish confidences from one who was no longer a child,
Marjorie told him some news which surprised him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Julia has changed very much. I like her now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must certainly have changed then,&#8221; said Maurice
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean,&#8221; Marjorie explained, &#8220;that she is different
to other people&mdash;only to mamma and myself. Her servants
are in terror of her, and her tenants hate her, and so on;
but she has been really kind to me. I think she likes me.
We were staying with her a few weeks ago. You&#8217;ll be
surprised to hear that she likes you too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Maurice, &#8220;it is surprising that any one
likes me, as you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I said that. She told me quite suddenly
once that she liked Maurice Grey, because he was the
cleverest man she knew in one respect. Mamma suggested
that it was because you understood her. &#8216;No, my dear,&#8217; said
Aunt Julia, &#8216;the village people do that, because I speak
plainly, and they try to pay me back again for it. He
always misunderstood me. I like him. He will not do
much, because he can&#8217;t concentrate himself on one thing;
but I like Maurice Grey all the same.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie did not repeat any more of Aunt Julia&#8217;s conversation;
but the old lady had gone on to say that Maurice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
however, would probably concentrate himself on one person.
She added, in her point-blank way, that she intended him
ultimately to marry Marjorie. She did not appear to think
that Marjorie, or Maurice, or Mrs. Meyner, could have a
voice in the matter; the marriage was one of the things
that the perverse old woman had made up her mind to
arrange.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad that dear old lady likes me,&#8221; said Maurice.
&#8220;I always liked her&mdash;I really did. She was full of such
striking and impressive contrasts&mdash;the soft, purring voice and
the ill-tempered words&mdash;her gentle, peaceful face and her
fearful pugnacity. And I like her more because she has
been good to you, you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever,&#8221; asked Marjorie, hurriedly going to
another subject, &#8220;find out anything new about the intelligence
of the brute creation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I used to tell some lies about a favourite terrier
of mine once, and made myself believe them. No, Marjorie,
that has not been my line. It has been quite enough to
find out that I and you, and all the rest of us, have got no
intelligence worth mentioning, none that will do a thousandth
part of what we want it to do. What made you ask that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking about that beetle you found on the
common when you were stopping with us once, and about
the dream I had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never found the dead beetle, although I hunted
everywhere for it, and I never remembered what it told me
about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not tell you at the time, Marjorie, but I had a
dream about the beetle that same night. It came to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
that night and told me everything I wanted to know&mdash;the
things I have been working at for the last two years. Of
course, they were all gone when I awoke, but I can remember
it saying that I should know them all one day. I am afraid
that dead beetle lied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maurice,&#8221; said Marjorie suddenly, &#8220;sometimes a thought
flashes across my mind that in a minute I may be dead.
I don&#8217;t know even what life and death mean; yet I have to
live and die. There are stars above me, but I do not know
why they are there. There are beasts, and birds, and
insects everywhere, and I do not know how important they
are. I feel lost and horrible. No, I feel like a prisoner
beating against an iron wall. For a few moments it is
torture to be like that; I should kill myself or go mad if
it went on. But it always passes away, and three minutes
afterwards I am wondering if I will do my hair a different
way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; murmured Maurice, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or I can be really angry because my maid knocks
something over, or does something clumsy; when one
speaks of it, it seems absurd enough. Speaking spoils
everything. Lovers&mdash;in books, I mean&mdash;talk the worst
nonsense, and yet that nonsense is the expression of a very
fine thing. I do not think that silence is enough appreciated.
I want, for instance, to let you know what I am
thinking. Well, when I put the thought into words, I lose
some of it, or add something to it, or I alter it by an
accident with the tone of my voice. Now if I could just
look at you and you at me, and we could understand one
another exactly through silence, it would be splendid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice agreed with her. After two years of disappointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
silence seemed to him almost the only thing left.
There was, however, one thing even more consolatory.
About a year after this conversation with Marjorie the two
met once more, and Maurice put his failures behind him
and told Marjorie that he loved her. So they both spoke
the nonsense which they deprecated. We all believe that
in affairs of the heart we are not as the others, and we are
all mistaken. With him there was an iteration of &#8220;I love
you,&#8221; with a deep tremble in the voice; and with her there
was a sighing echo of the same words, coming up between
blushes. The expression of the feeling was almost ludicrous;
the feeling itself was so sacred that the lightest touch of
thought seemed to soil it, and a writer, after turning over
his vocabulary in disgust, can find nothing explanatory
which at all matches it. But when it took place, it seemed
to Maurice the only important thing that ever had happened
to him; the psychological studies, which had brought him
so much disappointment, appeared in a new light as a
plaything that had seemed to amuse him until love
came.</p>

<p>This did not happen at Paris. Maurice had returned to
England, and all of them&mdash;Mrs. Meyner, Marjorie, and
Maurice&mdash;were staying in Aunt Julia&#8217;s house. It was a
lonely old house, much too big for that one wicked old
lady; it stood outside a North Yorkshire village, just where
a grand, dignified old hill drew back its skirts, with a sharp
sweep, from contamination with human dwelling-places.
Aunt Julia owned quarries at the foot of the hill, and got
therefrom more money than was good for her. The time
was December, and the moors looked bleak and cold. But
it was a comfortable house. Aunt Julia had devoted her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
many years to the study of comfort&mdash;her own comfort.
&#8220;There is nothing to shoot,&#8221; she explained to Maurice,
&#8220;except my tenants down in the village. You can shoot
them, if you like. There&#8217;s the library, though, which is
good, and you can smoke anywhere you like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you used to hate smoking?&#8221; said Maurice.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Maurice, there are two of me, and you used
to know the wrong one. Down in the village they mostly
know the wrong one, and they call her, I am told, the hell-cat,
which is rude of them. Yes, you can smoke anywhere.
If you and Marjorie want to go out of the house&mdash;which is
a thing I never do in December&mdash;I believe there are some
horses round at the back. If there is anything wrong about
the horses, or Pilkin, or anything that is his, just tell me,
and I will say a word or two. I believe the man presumes
on my ignorance. You can go and see my quarries, or my
cottages; but you had better not go to the cottages, because
they have no drains. I should like to give them some
drains, but the tenants won&#8217;t let me. They are poor people,
and a strong smell makes a difference to their colourless
existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Maurice did a certain amount of reading, riding, and
smoking. But, of course, Marjorie made for him the chief
charm of the house. Mrs. Meyner had willingly consented
to the engagement; even if she had desired to oppose it,
her more strenuous half-sister would have reasoned her out
of it; or, to use her own gentle euphemism, would have
said a word or two. The days passed quietly enough. To
Maurice they were a pleasant rest after his three years of
wasted laboriousness. &#8220;Marjorie,&#8221; he said to her one
afternoon, when they had wandered over the dignified hill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
and as they came back saw the bare boughs of the trees in
the plantation black against a red blot of sunset, &#8220;Marjorie,
I have done with all questions. I am here, and you are
here, and that is enough for me. I am going to live and
love, and enjoy. Blessed be my fate that has saved me
from the sordid worry of life. (Just wait a second, will
you? can&#8217;t get a match to light in this wind.) We will
make a beautiful house, with beautiful things in it, with
good books on shelves, and good wine in the cellar, and a
good cook in the kitchen. And no one shall enter into
that house who is not either very beautiful, or very clever,
or too good for this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall be so lonely there without you,&#8221; said
Marjorie, gently, with her sparkling eyes looking groundwards.</p>

<p>Maurice laughed. &#8220;Ah, Marjorie, you and I will be
one, and you are more beautiful, and clever, and better
than any one in the world. That is how I shall have a
right to come into my own beautiful house. We will
trouble ourselves with no theories about anything. We
will not get excited about anything; an excited man always
has been, or will be, dull. We will make life one long,
gentle enjoyment.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke half in jest and half in earnest, telling his soul
of beautiful things laid up in that house for many years;
bidding himself to eat, and drink, and enjoy judiciously.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because Marjorie at that moment looked
towards the sunset. It seemed so far away from her, and
yet so desirable. She had the fancy, common among
children and poets, that the dying light looked the gate of
some wonderful place to be seen hereafter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maurice, Maurice!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Look at that. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
have the lost, prisoned feeling again when I look at it. It
is too far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night ended all. There were beautiful things to
come, so it seemed to both of them, such poetry and love
as never had been before; and all was stopped by an
accident, one commonplace accident, almost too poor to be
put into a story.</p>

<p>Marjorie had been subdued, almost depressed; she had
talked but little at dinner or afterwards. Mrs. Meyner and
Marjorie both went to bed rather early. Maurice, restless
from his love-passion, had gone to walk and smoke for an
hour on the fell-side. Aunt Julia sat before the fire in the
drawing-room, waiting for Maurice to return, reading a
favourite chapter of Gibbon.</p>

<p>For some time one would have said that Marjorie was
sleeping quietly and peacefully. Then suddenly she sat
up in bed, her eyes still closed. She began talking in her
sleep. &#8220;Tell me! Come back again and tell me. I <i>will</i>
know. I am on the verge, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221; She stopped
talking; quickly she moved from the bed to the dressing-table,
and her fingers fumbled impatiently with the opening
of her dressing-case. She had drawn up the blind, and the
moonlight shone straight upon her. Her lips were still
moving, but no sound came. She opened the dressing-case
and took from it a glass jar which was filled with old dead
rose leaves. She had filled it herself long before, when she
was a child. She unscrewed the silver top, and began to
take out the rose leaves very carefully. At the bottom of
the jar she found the thing for which she had been looking,
and laid it on the palm of her little white hand. It was the
withered body of a large dead beetle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>For a moment she stood thus. And then she drew a
long breath, and opened her eyes wide. She was awake,
and she had remembered the horrible thing which she had
heard in a dream and had forgotten. Quivering and almost
breathless she hurried from the room, just as she was.</p>

<p>Aunt Julia had good nerves, but she was a little startled
when the door of the drawing-room was flung open, and
she saw, standing in the doorway, the figure of Marjorie,
white-robed, bare-footed, with both hands stretched out,
and struggling in vain, as it seemed, to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjorie! What is it?&#8221; cried Aunt Julia in a shaking
voice.</p>

<p>She found words at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maurice is dead&mdash;dead! He fell&mdash;I saw him fall&mdash;over
there, against the plantation, down into the quarry.
He is dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed a burst of hysterical laughter, more bitter
than any tears, and then she fainted away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Aunt Julia stood in the porch, looking out. She was
white to the lips. By the moonlight she could see the
procession coming nearer&mdash;two men carrying lanterns, four
men carrying a hurdle with a burden upon it, covered up
altogether because it was broken and ghastly.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
